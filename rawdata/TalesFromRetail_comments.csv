1,d5nny6k,t3_4u89p9,I  took a quarter out of my own wallet to spot a customer once and they didn't come back and give me a $20. I feel cheated.,t3_4u89p9
2,d5nm38s,t3_4u89p9,These are the stories I love to read on this sub,t3_4u89p9
3,d5nn9wz,t3_4u89p9,"What a kind young man. I mean $0.36 is nothing. I've done things like said don't worry about it. I went to buy something the other day and I had small change, I was counting it first I didn't know if I had enough and the woman said to just get as close as I could. As it was I had enough but she was just so nice about it. But for him to come back and do that. It goes to show how much of a difference you made to his day. This is just the sweet kind of story I like to see at this time in the morning.",t3_4u89p9
4,d5no8qj,t3_4u89p9,Same has happened to me. A woman was 10¢ short so I said it was fine and that I'd just cover it with my tips since it was on a dime. She came back an hour later and gave me a $10 tip.,t3_4u89p9
5,d5npx35,t3_4u89p9,"Similar situation happened with me but vice versa. There's a burger place in Copenhagen called Banana Joe's (little shop but very popular and juicy burgers) and inside there is the large, friendly owner who works there almost every day. I'm on my way to my friends so I order 3 Cheese&Bacons + fries to go. I wait 5 minutes or so and he hands me the bag and I ask him if it's ok that I pay by card (in Copenhagen a lot of stuff is done through cards/mobile pay) but he says I cannot and I offer to quickly pop to the ATM and withdraw money (not that far away). He stops me and says ""No no. I want you to enjoy these burgers fresh and warm, stop by tomorrow and pay."" 

So there I am somewhat starstruck with what he's saying and ask him if he's sure. He says yes and to enjoy my evening. The next day I take the bus back to his and pay him an extra 10 dollars, he almost refused that too but I insisted. I just hope that other uni students like myself have shown him the same courtesy and not shade the guy.",t3_4u89p9

7,d5nor89,t3_4u89p9,"I wish customers realized that if you act like a decent human being, the employees will treat you well. Like at the store I worked in, if you showed your membership card for the shopping center, you'd get a percentage off if your total was over a certain amount. We didn't have to physically collect anything or swipe anything, so it was totally untracked. On one occasion, a customer had a $110 purchase with a ton of little things, but she was a couple bucks short on cash. She apologized profusely and asked if I could put her purchase on hold so she could run out to her car and get some more cash, apologizing the whole time. I didn't feel like going through the effort it would take to hold this transaction and didn't want to make her run to the car, so I just entered the coupon and said ""ok you have enough cash now.""

On the other hand, I once had a customer who was a few bucks short and he said really belligerently ""I don't feel like going to my car, help me out man. Is there anything you can do?"" ""Nope."" ""Dude, what's your problem?"" ""You don't have cash.""",t3_4u89p9

9,d5noo79,t3_4u89p9,I once gave a small kid €0.50 because I didn't want to wait for him to change his order to something cheaper.

13,d5ntzj9,t3_4u89p9,"I had just moved to a new city, and I walked into one of the local hardware stores to buy a keyring for my new apartment keys. Old school place, very small. Just a couple of old dudes with bushy white mustaches in the back, the whole shop floor covered in sawdust. 

I find the size I want, and the guy tells me it's $0.25. I pull out my credit card (cause I'm a millenial, and I don't carry cash. Fuck me right?) He explains that they can't handle credit cards. He tells me to just take it. It's only 25 cents.

I thank him and walk back to my car where I remember I had my laundry money in the back seat. I grab 50 cents and run back to the store. I paid him 50 cents because I felt that his charity needed to be rewarded.

It's not as much as the kid from your story, but I felt a whole lot better knowing that I was able to, in some small way, reward a charitable deed.",t3_4u89p9

what. 

so i hand him my card, he tells me they don't take cards...

i have $24 cash on me, super bummed, he says no worries, i'll take care of it!

i went back to my seat, enjoyed my drink, and when i went to the bathroom i found out the theatre allowed readmittance, so i just walked to an ATM, took out cash, went back to that guy's line, waited behind two people, and handed him $20 with a thank you and went back to my seat.

I was so embarrassed but the manager didn't hesitate and absolutely insisted on giving me the food anyway. I went back to my hotel, gobbled my food, and rushed back to pay. She was actually really surprised and said most people don't come back. Wow. I asked, why did you give it me, then? And she said ""I will never give up my faith in humanity, thanks to people like you.""

That happened 7 years ago. I haven't given up on humanity either because of that incident. I used to be so damned pessimistic about humanity. I hated everyone. Amazing how such a small act as 'not having the right form of payment' can end up changing one's entire life.

I managed to get someone to break a $20 into like two fives and singles and returned the dollar to them.

For example, kid has $5 gift certificate and orders a $5 banana split. The cost of product is $1.00, they sell it for $5.00, but with tax it comes to $5.36. They have already made the banana split with the toppings the kid wanted. If the sale is voided they give him back the $5 gift card and are stuck with food that cost the store $1 to make, that they now have to throw away.  Better to make $3.64 in profit than lose a buck. 

Hooking up a high school kid for 36 cents is worth it for the employee as well, because if that kid didn't know he should tip before, he does now and will return with friends and tip every time. ",t3_4u89p9

That's just it. The store would still make its full $4.64 profit because the store wouldn't be the one paying the difference, it's the cashier who took it out of their own tip money. So there's no reason for the business owner to be upset about the 36 cents.",t3_4u89p9
