He decided he is going to give it up to raise his kids, only to be encouraged to at least give the senate try. 

So his sister moves in with him and helps raise his kids. As he commutes from Delaware to DC in a train to be a dad and Senator. 

He then goes on to serve 30 years in the senate.  

Then 8 years as Vice President, under our first African American president.  He was also the first major politician to speak out for gay marriage (he said it before Obama). 

Keep in mind, VP is a largely thankless job and is essentially a resume builder to be president. 

But then in 2016. He didn‚Äôt run.  He left the gate open for our first woman president. 

Then, he has a child die of brain cancer. 

Joe Biden, who could retire and forever be already known as a great American, decides to run for president as a unifier during one of the most divided times in American politics. in addition,he adds the first woman of color on a major party ticket.

As a former Republican from Texas, can I please say:

They don't want your guns. Obama was born in America. There were no emails for crooked Hillary, nor were there Mexican gangs roaming the suburbs. There was no Antifa attack. There is no laptop. And there is no voter fraud. 

How many times can someone cry wolf here? They pulled these tactics when I was voting for Bush and it never led anywhere.

There was, however, an investigation that led to multiple Presidential staffers and campaign managers being given prison time for their involvement in the 2016 campaign. 

Why don't Republicans care about this?

The only thing the last administration did was give massive tax cuts to corporations, sever our control on a global scale, and undermined our democracy.

This is not the Republican party I grew up with. This has been a sham and a tarnish on what used to be a party that stood on Christian morals and values. The party has thrown their character to the wind.

The Republican party lost its way when it embraced the misguided lies and got away from policy. I haven't voted Republican in years, but the party has only sank further and further from what it used to be.

I actually hope you guys get it together, as diverse opinions are the embodiment of democracy. I know this will be deleted but I had to get it off my chest. 

I really want us to work together again.

I keep thinking of this quote from The West Wing: ""Every once in a while there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong. But those days almost always include body counts.""

In my eyes, voting out Donald Trump is an absolute right to undo an absolute wrong, and unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this absolute right came with a still growing body count.

There's still a lot work that needs to be done in the United States, with the pandemic as well as all the other issues we've been dealing with for years if not centuries. While Trump might see the consequences of his actions and negligence beyond losing re-election, his supporters (whether they're the elected officials and media personalities that enabled him or your neighbors that voted for him) aren't going anywhere. The loopholes that allowed this administration to happen need to be closed and the issues he exploited need to fixed from the ground up.

Joe Biden won't fix everything. No president can. But if nothing else his victory means we, at the very least, have the chance to do so, a chance we probably wouldn't have otherwise. He wasn't my first choice by any means and I still think he needs to work to right the wrongs he committed in the past. But I'll sleep better knowing the President of the United States cares whether I live or die from this virus. It's a long way to Germany but at least we've secured Omaha Beach.

My stomach sank as I realized it wasn't just a bad dream. I asked myself, ""How the fuck could this happen?"" I worried for my country and whether it could survive such an abomination of a human being.


The next morning, I ugly cried at work during Hillary's concession speech as all the MAGA cult members bought their morning papers and coffees with shit-eating grins on their faces. I spent the next few weeks in a depressive haze as everyone around me chastised me for ""overreacting"" and telling me it couldn't get that bad because of checks and balances.


Fuck those people.


This racist motherfucker has robbed so many of us of four years of our lives. My mental health hadn't been great before his election, but his presidency -- especially the last two years of it -- have been nothing short of toxic for my well-being. These are moments of our lives we will never get back, and thanks to his deliberate sabotage of any real covid response, almost a quarter million Americans (so far) have had those lives cut short.


Donald Trump came very close to destroying American democracy. And while we are not out of the woods yet, I finally have real hope that this country is not a lost cause. I am mortified that this election was as close as it was, and our division won't be fixed overnight, but at least today I can stop bracing myself for a potentially imminent authoritarian takeover. At worst, we've paused it for another four years.


This administration must be held accountable for every horrendous act they've committed and every heinous policy they've enacted. It is time to throw the book at these treasonous fuckers if we are to ever survive this dark time in our nation's history.


This morning, I cried again -- but these were tears of relief. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I felt a sense of relief wash over me. It's been such a long four fucking years. Soon, I won't have to dread checking the news every day to see what awful shit this administration has done to its people.


We have collectively, as a nation, been in an abusive relationship with a malignant narcissist since our last presidential election, and now we have finally broken free.

>The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans ‚Äî whether you voted for me or not.

>I will keep the faith that you have placed in me.

For contrast, statement from loser in chief:

>‚ÄúWe all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don‚Äôt want the truth to be exposed. The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process.  Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media.

#

>‚ÄúBeginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election. It remains shocking that the Biden campaign refuses to agree with this basic principle and wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters. Only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room ‚Äì and then fight in court to block their access.  

#

450,gbh3o6z,t3_jptq5n,"Some people asked me. As an Indian living in India, why am I so invested in what's happening with the US elections. I took some time to put this down.

  


Trump was never going to accept defeat. We already knew who he is... This is not unexpected. It's a problem how people underestimated how vile this man is, and what he is capable of. And it continues to remain the fault of Americans who underestimate the magnitude of damage a man with such tendencies can cause to a democracy. Thankfully, it seems right now better sense prevailed.

  


Some ask, how will it affect us in India - well, it absolutely does. If it's possible for a person to subvert democracy in a country with such strong institutions, imagine what can happen in countries where democracy is still in its nascent stages, like in India. We haven't had dearth of leaders across party lines with autocratic tendencies - it would not take them too long to take a leaf out of Trump's playbook.

  


However weak a democracy India maybe, people have power atleast on 1 day in 5 years.

  


Some even ask, what's the use of democracy. Yes, democracies are not perfect - things don't happen at the pace we would want them to happen, there is a lot of corruption, there is a lot of uncertainty, policies change too often, etc. But at the end of the day, it gives its people the power to change the government. Without this power, people would be at the mercy of an autocrat/party which rules for only its own interest - not that for its people. Look at what's happening in Pakistan, Turkey, China, Russia.

  


This is why I think the present American election is important. If Trump wins, or somehow wrestles into power, it would be pivotal movement for liberal democracies across the world. Especially weak democracies like India.

645,gbhm4pc,t3_jptq5n,"Someone asked ""Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?"" Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England, wrote this magnificent response: ""A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace ‚Äì all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed. So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump‚Äôs limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief. Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing ‚Äì not once, ever. I don‚Äôt say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility ‚Äì for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman. But with Trump, it‚Äôs a fact. He doesn‚Äôt even seem to understand what a joke is ‚Äì his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty. Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers. And scarily, he doesn‚Äôt just talk in crude, witless insults ‚Äì he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness. There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It‚Äôs all surface. 

Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront. Well, we don‚Äôt. We see it as having no inner world, no soul. And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist. Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that. He‚Äôs not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat. He‚Äôs more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege. And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully. That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead. There are unspoken rules to this stuff ‚Äì the Queensberry rules of basic decency ‚Äì and he breaks them all. He punches downwards ‚Äì which a gentleman should, would, could never do ‚Äì and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless ‚Äì and he kicks them when they are down. So the fact that a significant minority ‚Äì perhaps a third ‚Äì of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think ‚ÄôYeah, he seems like my kind of guy‚Äô is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:

&#x200B;

Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are. You don‚Äôt need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man. This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss. After all, it‚Äôs impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum. God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of 
nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart. In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws ‚Äì he would make a Trump. And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish: ‚ÄôMy God‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶ have‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ created? If being a twat was a TV show, Trump would be the boxed set.""

A mishandled international crisis, hundreds of thousands of dead Americans, and pure unfettered corruption.  But we are lucky. Trump's destruction of our institutions will present a unique opportunity to rebuild them, in the image of a modern nation state.

It has shown that there is not much preventing everything from going off the rails-- but at the same time, it shows us that there is hope for change and progress.

That's why you don't really know them. 4 years of racism was rejected by myself and over 70 million Americans. In your history books it will be explained as a quick timeline where America flirted with Fascism but good overcame the bad. I'm here to tell you it was the longest 4 years of my life. I've lost more friends and family than ever before. I feel isolated even in victory. Your mom is the only one I'm willing to spend my days with because I have lost faith in my neighbors. Especially in our deep red state. I quit my job in EMS on August 31st. The pandemic burned me out. The racism and misinformation burned me out. Your dad tried to be a good person for a time. But this evil Presidency has burned me out. I protested for black lives as a white man. I became self employed when I couldn't find a new job. Kids please understand if you read this in the future, we good people who stood against the loud, violent, xenophobic, and ignorant, are tired on this day. Sure we're happy. We just hope it's worth it. And by the time you read this you're able to smoke weed, at a gay wedding, while your drunk friends hospital bill is clear the next morning. We want yall to have fun with life. We fight this shit so you don't have to. However those who fought in WWII felt the same way. And here we are again. Stepping on Fascisms throat. Your generation will have it's own fight. Hopefully I'm still around to help. Even if it's true and I become more conservative as I age. I hope it's just conservative and not radically misinformed. To the next generation may your lives be happy, your education better than ours, and your Healthcare a right. To the Trump supporters. Here's an olive branch. Take down the flags, scrap off the bumper stickers, and stand down. We don't want to fight you anymore. You were conned by social media, Vladimir Putin, and a racist Populist movement. It's time for the party of personal responsibility to take personal responsibility. Time correct the course. If not for yourselves at least for your kids.

He has been completely insulated for four years by family and sycophants that only say positive things about him. They cherry-pick the information they give him to appease his ego. He gets reinforced by Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and so on, and it's topped off by his rallies full of adoring fans ready to take a ride in a COVID mosh pit for him.

All that being the case, I believe he truly believed he couldn't lose. A narcissist fabricates reality with themselves at the center, and every other piece of information is filtered through the lens of self as center. Mainstream media hates him? Fake news. Underling disagrees with him publicly? Fire their ass. Polls don't look good? Gotta be wrong (he was actually kinda right on that one).

So for someone who believes all of that so strongly, and is still surrounded by an inner circle of people like Giuliani, Sean Hannity and the Trump larvae to reinforce that belief, why would a little thing like reality change his mind?

Trump will leave the Oval Office on January 20, but he will ALWAYS believe he was robbed of this election, and he will always have millions of people to reinforce that belief.",t3_jptq5n

It's largely the same choice faced in 2008 but on a much bigger, and much more divisive scale. Back then, it was largely decided to let Bush era corruption go in favor of unity. Unfortunately, that lead directly to people like Trump acting even more emboldened to act without fear of consequence.

It's a really difficult balancing act. On the one hand, you risk so much violence and aggression. On the other, people need to fear consequence or they'll continue to corrupt the machinations of our government in worse and worse ways.

We only have a four year reprieve before there's a possibility that he'll come back or someone similar. We need to use the system to prevent this and harden our elections to be more resistant to this kind of tampering in the future.

We need to ensure that Education initiatives get the money they need, and we should make it so that all American's have the option to vote, by mail or the day of the election.

* An enlarged House
* Nullifying the electoral colleges/making the popular vote more important for Presidential elections
* More transparency, accountability and making it harder to suppress votes like it is in other developed countries.

I'm 30 year old white dude. It's a beautiful November 7th Saturday. I just had lunch and am smoking some ""Sundae Driver"" Cannabis in a medically legal state. 

I am so thankful to see this chapter of American history is closed. For the past 4 years I have seen the country get split apart by divisiveness. Trump has made our country an embarrassment. The hate cast to our immigrants, Americans of color and the LGBTQ crowd was so incredibly sad and demoralizing. Injustice grew throughout the country for anyone not within the Trump supporters goals. Trump would blame entire American cities for being bad places because a democrat was the mayor. In this period of time the rise of the alt-right came with the outspoken science deniers and White Nationalists. Somehow wearing a fask mask to protect other Americans and yourself from the Coronavirus became politicized. I can't believe this is where we are. Coronavirus just went over 120k positive case rate for the first time. My Father In Law has been in the hospital for Coronavirus for a week as of today. He appears to of just turned the corner in not needing a ventilator. He got the virus by going to a christian rally that had 2k+ people... 
.
Throughout this presidency, I kept wondering if this is what Pre-War Germany looked like in the 30s. The rise of a nationalist and racist figure head with a party that denies anything that isn't part of their platform without evidence.

I was a supporter of Bernie Sanders initially with his promise of universal healthcare and college loan forgiveness and a progressive agenda that I want to see. Seeing now that Biden won was the right move even though it will take longer to get to the goals I want achieved with our government and our society. It was the right move for this time.
