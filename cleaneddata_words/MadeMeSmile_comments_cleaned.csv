Suddenly I didn’t see him for two months until one evening right before closing he showed up, cracked a quick joke and told me something that made me cry in the back room and I still do when I think about it to this day.

His wife had been battling stage 4 breast cancer for almost two years and said she enjoyed every watermelon he ever brought home and it was one of the few things she was actually able to eat.

And when you do that, you point out to them that their memories are wrong or not theirs, and they get frustrated and angry.

Join them on their journey and you'll actually find it's a beautiful thing.  Because while they are certainly losing their memory, you'll find their sense of humor and personality to be very similar.

When I was in college I volunteered with a group at the local university that paired students with a person that had been diagnosed with dementia. Over the next year, we met up once a week and went a museum. One of my favorite things to do was to bring him by this sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that he just adored. He always told me that he liked it because he had experienced it with his wife many years ago. This story changed every single time he told it but did it matter? HELL NO 

The joy he felt being in the present moment and having this “memory” brought him so much happiness I would have heard that story 50 more times and it still wouldn’t have mattered. The reality is that with this disease, the happy times are rare. It is incredibly hard on the person and the caretaker so any time there is something that brings joy into their world. It is just... the best. 

Furthermore, for me now that I am in medical school, I would recommend to anyone that is interested in this field to work with the elderly. Working with this man taught me more about life, its hardships, our identity, love, and pain than any class or shadowing experience I ever had and he never even really knew my name.

We were a rural hospital so I explained everything that was happening to her and her husband and quickly organized a transport to a stroke center. A few days later, she was sent back to wait in our hospital for her bed in rehab. 

About 18 months later, she came to my ward for a simple infection that needed i.v. Antibiotics. She talked a lot without really being able to form a complete sentence or make sense at all (Wernicke aphasia). This was all that seemed to have remained from her stroke but it was so bad, I could hardly understand her. I felt really bad for her, but she seemed very happy all the time. After two days, her husband caught me in the hallway and gave me a letter, thanking me profusely. In the letter, he had written how eternally thankful they were to me for helping in his wife's recovery. Specifically that I took the time to explain everything to them, eventhough it had to be a stressful moment for me. How she had re-learned to walk and even ride a bike. And how they are now able to go bird-watching together - something they didn't thing would be possible after the stroke. The letter included a blue feather from some rare bird they had seen. They said it was extremely rare to find a feather like that and they wanted me to have it. 

You Bett I still have this letter s d the feather. I reread it often when I struggled with my profession and it has been an eye-opener. I realized that even the smallest thing I do for people in acute crisis can have the most profound impact that goes way beyond the physical necessity. And that I always need to be aware of that and empathic to the crisis my patients are in.",t3_ho4otc,"i,once,got,a,letter,like,that,i,wa,a,resident,on,er,duty,and,a,woman,came,in,with,a,stroke,we,were,a,rural,hospital,so,i,explained,everything,that,wa,happening,to,her,and,her,husband,and,quickly,organized,a,transport,to,a,stroke,center,a,few,day,later,she,wa,sent,back,to,wait,in,our,hospital,for,her,bed,in,rehab,about,18,month,later,she,came,to,my,ward,for,a,simple,infection,that,needed,i,v,antibiotic,she,talked,a,lot,without,really,being,able,to,form,a,complete,sentence,or,make,sense,at,all,wernicke,aphasia,this,wa,all,that,seemed,to,have,remained,from,her,stroke,but,it,wa,so,bad,i,could,hardly,understand,her,i,felt,really,bad,for,her,but,she,seemed,very,happy,all,the,time,after,two,day,her,husband,caught,me,in,the,hallway,and,gave,me,a,letter,thanking,me,profusely,in,the,letter,he,had,written,how,eternally,thankful,they,were,to,me,for,helping,in,his,wife,s,recovery,specifically,that,i,took,the,time,to,explain,everything,to,them,eventhough,it,had,to,be,a,stressful,moment,for,me,how,she,had,re,learned,to,walk,and,even,ride,a,bike,and,how,they,are,now,able,to,go,bird,watching,together,something,they,didn,t,thing,would,be,possible,after,the,stroke,the,letter,included,a,blue,feather,from,some,rare,bird,they,had,seen,they,said,it,wa,extremely,rare,to,find,a,feather,like,that,and,they,wanted,me,to,have,it,you,bett,i,still,have,this,letter,s,d,the,feather,i,reread,it,often,when,i,struggled,with,my,profession,and,it,ha,been,an,eye,opener,i,realized,that,even,the,smallest,thing,i,do,for,people,in,acute,crisis,can,have,the,most,profound,impact,that,go,way,beyond,the,physical,necessity,and,that,i,always,need,to,be,aware,of,that,and,empathic,to,the,crisis,my,patient,are,in"

The Best hairdresser I ever had did my hair every time between the ages of 14 and 18. The last time was for my high school graduation. I wasn't opposed to having any colour or style of hair so I sort of just let her go crazy and experiment. I would literally give her free reign to do whatever she wanted and I loved it every fucking time (and she loved me for it).

She had black and white portrait tattoos on her biceps of Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash, short blonde hair (kind of pinup style) and I thought she was so fucking cool. And as an ugly duckling kind of awkward teenager with low self esteem, she made me feel so pretty and confident.

I wish I could find her again so badly but all I have is a first name and a description.

Marissa from Calgary, if you're reading this by some fucking miracle, please DM me! Or if you know her, please DM me.

Sometimes I do go home at the end of the day and my husband will be trying to chat and I have to tell him that it’s like I’ve literally run out of words for the day. Used up my quota, ask again tomorrow. But there are so many people who have become friends, who I genuinely care for, and I can’t imagine not being able to keep in touch with them. It makes my whole day to feel like I gave someone a boost. 

This week a lady cried in my chair because she had had an awful time in quarantine and was so happy to feel like herself again. I was honestly really afraid to come back to work and I still am afraid of getting sick, but it just felt so good to help someone who was also having a hard time. 

Especially when it’s someone who has really struggled with their identity or appearance or confidence; shy teenagers, or clients with conditions that effect their hair that make them self conscious, or people transitioning who are learning to be confident presenting themselves in a different way.
