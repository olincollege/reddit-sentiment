He decided he is going to give it up to raise his kids, only to be encouraged to at least give the senate try. 

So his sister moves in with him and helps raise his kids. As he commutes from Delaware to DC in a train to be a dad and Senator. 

He then goes on to serve 30 years in the senate.  

Then 8 years as Vice President, under our first African American president.  He was also the first major politician to speak out for gay marriage (he said it before Obama). 

Keep in mind, VP is a largely thankless job and is essentially a resume builder to be president. 

But then in 2016. He didn‚Äôt run.  He left the gate open for our first woman president. 

Then, he has a child die of brain cancer. 

Joe Biden, who could retire and forever be already known as a great American, decides to run for president as a unifier during one of the most divided times in American politics. in addition,he adds the first woman of color on a major party ticket.

As a former Republican from Texas, can I please say:

They don't want your guns. Obama was born in America. There were no emails for crooked Hillary, nor were there Mexican gangs roaming the suburbs. There was no Antifa attack. There is no laptop. And there is no voter fraud. 

How many times can someone cry wolf here? They pulled these tactics when I was voting for Bush and it never led anywhere.

There was, however, an investigation that led to multiple Presidential staffers and campaign managers being given prison time for their involvement in the 2016 campaign. 

Why don't Republicans care about this?

The only thing the last administration did was give massive tax cuts to corporations, sever our control on a global scale, and undermined our democracy.

This is not the Republican party I grew up with. This has been a sham and a tarnish on what used to be a party that stood on Christian morals and values. The party has thrown their character to the wind.

The Republican party lost its way when it embraced the misguided lies and got away from policy. I haven't voted Republican in years, but the party has only sank further and further from what it used to be.

I actually hope you guys get it together, as diverse opinions are the embodiment of democracy. I know this will be deleted but I had to get it off my chest. 

I really want us to work together again.

I keep thinking of this quote from The West Wing: ""Every once in a while there's a day with an absolute right and an absolute wrong. But those days almost always include body counts.""

In my eyes, voting out Donald Trump is an absolute right to undo an absolute wrong, and unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this absolute right came with a still growing body count.

There's still a lot work that needs to be done in the United States, with the pandemic as well as all the other issues we've been dealing with for years if not centuries. While Trump might see the consequences of his actions and negligence beyond losing re-election, his supporters (whether they're the elected officials and media personalities that enabled him or your neighbors that voted for him) aren't going anywhere. The loopholes that allowed this administration to happen need to be closed and the issues he exploited need to fixed from the ground up.

Joe Biden won't fix everything. No president can. But if nothing else his victory means we, at the very least, have the chance to do so, a chance we probably wouldn't have otherwise. He wasn't my first choice by any means and I still think he needs to work to right the wrongs he committed in the past.

My stomach sank as I realized it wasn't just a bad dream. I asked myself, ""How the fuck could this happen?"" I worried for my country and whether it could survive such an abomination of a human being.


The next morning, I ugly cried at work during Hillary's concession speech as all the MAGA cult members bought their morning papers and coffees with shit-eating grins on their faces. I spent the next few weeks in a depressive haze as everyone around me chastised me for ""overreacting"" and telling me it couldn't get that bad because of checks and balances.


Fuck those people.


This racist motherfucker has robbed so many of us of four years of our lives. My mental health hadn't been great before his election, but his presidency -- especially the last two years of it -- have been nothing short of toxic for my well-being. These are moments of our lives we will never get back, and thanks to his deliberate sabotage of any real covid response, almost a quarter million Americans (so far) have had those lives cut short.


Donald Trump came very close to destroying American democracy. And while we are not out of the woods yet, I finally have real hope that this country is not a lost cause. I am mortified that this election was as close as it was, and our division won't be fixed overnight, but at least today I can stop bracing myself for a potentially imminent authoritarian takeover. At worst, we've paused it for another four years.


This administration must be held accountable for every horrendous act they've committed and every heinous policy they've enacted. It is time to throw the book at these treasonous fuckers if we are to ever survive this dark time in our nation's history.


This morning, I cried again -- but these were tears of relief. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I felt a sense of relief wash over me. It's been such a long four fucking years. Soon, I won't have to dread checking the news every day to see what awful shit this administration has done to its people.


We have collectively, as a nation, been in an abusive relationship with a malignant narcissist since our last presidential election, and now we have finally broken free.


To all women, POC, my LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters, and anyone else this despicable man has hurt and marginalized: we're gonna be okay. They can't hurt us anymore.

>America, I‚Äôm honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country.

>The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans ‚Äî whether you voted for me or not.

>I will keep the faith that you have placed in me.

For contrast, statement from loser in chief:

>‚ÄúWe all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don‚Äôt want the truth to be exposed. The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process.  Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media.

#

>‚ÄúBeginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election. It remains shocking that the Biden campaign refuses to agree with this basic principle and wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters. Only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room ‚Äì and then fight in court to block their access.  

#

>‚ÄúSo what is Biden hiding? I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands.‚Äù

450,450,gbh3o6z,t3_jptq5n,"Some people asked me. As an Indian living in India, why am I so invested in what's happening with the US elections. I took some time to put this down.

  


Trump was never going to accept defeat. We already knew who he is... This is not unexpected. It's a problem how people underestimated how vile this man is, and what he is capable of. And it continues to remain the fault of Americans who underestimate the magnitude of damage a man with such tendencies can cause to a democracy. Thankfully, it seems right now better sense prevailed.

  


Some ask, how will it affect us in India - well, it absolutely does. If it's possible for a person to subvert democracy in a country with such strong institutions, imagine what can happen in countries where democracy is still in its nascent stages, like in India. We haven't had dearth of leaders across party lines with autocratic tendencies - it would not take them too long to take a leaf out of Trump's playbook.

  


However weak a democracy India maybe, people have power atleast on 1 day in 5 years.

  


Some even ask, what's the use of democracy. Yes, democracies are not perfect - things don't happen at the pace we would want them to happen, there is a lot of corruption, there is a lot of uncertainty, policies change too often, etc. But at the end of the day, it gives its people the power to change the government. Without this power, people would be at the mercy of an autocrat/party which rules for only its own interest - not that for its people. Look at what's happening in Pakistan, Turkey, China, Russia.

  


This is why I think the present American election is important. If Trump wins, or somehow wrestles into power, it would be pivotal movement for liberal democracies across the world. Especially weak democracies like India.

645,645,gbhm4pc,t3_jptq5n,"Someone asked ""Why do some British people not like Donald Trump?"" Nate White, an articulate and witty writer from England, wrote this magnificent response: ""A few things spring to mind. Trump lacks certain qualities which the British traditionally esteem. For instance, he has no class, no charm, no coolness, no credibility, no compassion, no wit, no warmth, no wisdom, no subtlety, no sensitivity, no self-awareness, no humility, no honour and no grace ‚Äì all qualities, funnily enough, with which his predecessor Mr. Obama was generously blessed. So for us, the stark contrast does rather throw Trump‚Äôs limitations into embarrassingly sharp relief. Plus, we like a laugh. And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing ‚Äì not once, ever. I don‚Äôt say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility ‚Äì for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman. But with Trump, it‚Äôs a fact. He doesn‚Äôt even seem to understand what a joke is ‚Äì his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty. Trump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers. And scarily, he doesn‚Äôt just talk in crude, witless insults ‚Äì he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness. There is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It‚Äôs all surface. 

Some Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront. Well, we don‚Äôt. We see it as having no inner world, no soul. And in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist. Trump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that. He‚Äôs not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat. He‚Äôs more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege. And worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully. That is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead. There are unspoken rules to this stuff ‚Äì the Queensberry rules of basic decency ‚Äì and he breaks them all. He punches downwards ‚Äì which a gentleman should, would, could never do ‚Äì and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless ‚Äì and he kicks them when they are down. So the fact that a significant minority ‚Äì perhaps a third ‚Äì of Americans look at what he does, listen to what he says, and then think ‚ÄôYeah, he seems like my kind of guy‚Äô is a matter of some confusion and no little distress to British people, given that:

&#x200B;

Americans are supposed to be nicer than us, and mostly are. You don‚Äôt need a particularly keen eye for detail to spot a few flaws in the man. This last point is what especially confuses and dismays British people, and many other people too; his faults seem pretty bloody hard to miss. After all, it‚Äôs impossible to read a single tweet, or hear him speak a sentence or two, without staring deep into the abyss. He turns being artless into an art form; he is a Picasso of pettiness; a Shakespeare of shit. His faults are fractal: even his flaws have flaws, and so on ad infinitum. God knows there have always been stupid people in the world, and plenty of 
nasty people too. But rarely has stupidity been so nasty, or nastiness so stupid. He makes Nixon look trustworthy and George W look smart. In fact, if Frankenstein decided to make a monster assembled entirely from human flaws ‚Äì he would make a Trump. And a remorseful Doctor Frankenstein would clutch out big clumpfuls of hair and scream in anguish: ‚ÄôMy God‚Ä¶ what‚Ä¶ have‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ created?

In your history books it will be explained as a quick timeline where America flirted with Fascism but good overcame the bad. I'm here to tell you it was the longest 4 years of my life. I've lost more friends and family than ever before. I feel isolated even in victory. Your mom is the only one I'm willing to spend my days with because I have lost faith in my neighbors. Especially in our deep red state. I quit my job in EMS on August 31st. The pandemic burned me out. The racism and misinformation burned me out. Your dad tried to be a good person for a time. But this evil Presidency has burned me out. I protested for black lives as a white man. I became self employed when I couldn't find a new job. Kids please understand if you read this in the future, we good people who stood against the loud, violent, xenophobic, and ignorant, are tired on this day. Sure we're happy. We just hope it's worth it. And by the time you read this you're able to smoke weed, at a gay wedding, while your drunk friends hospital bill is clear the next morning. We want yall to have fun with life. We fight this shit so you don't have to. However those who fought in WWII felt the same way. And here we are again. Stepping on Fascisms throat. Your generation will have it's own fight. Hopefully I'm still around to help. Even if it's true and I become more conservative as I age. I hope it's just conservative and not radically misinformed. To the next generation may your lives be happy, your education better than ours, and your Healthcare a right. To the Trump supporters. Here's an olive branch. Take down the flags, scrap off the bumper stickers, and stand down. We don't want to fight you anymore. You were conned by social media, Vladimir Putin, and a racist Populist movement.

All that being the case, I believe he truly believed he couldn't lose.

The hate cast to our immigrants, Americans of color and the LGBTQ crowd was so incredibly sad and demoralizing. Injustice grew throughout the country for anyone not within the Trump supporters goals. Trump would blame entire American cities for being bad places because a democrat was the mayor. In this period of time the rise of the alt-right came with the outspoken science deniers and White Nationalists. Somehow wearing a fask mask to protect other Americans and yourself from the Coronavirus became politicized. I can't believe this is where we are. Coronavirus just went over 120k positive case rate for the first time. My Father In Law has been in the hospital for Coronavirus for a week as of today. He appears to of just turned the corner in not needing a ventilator. He got the virus by going to a christian rally that had 2k+ people... 
.
Throughout this presidency, I kept wondering if this is what Pre-War Germany looked like in the 30s. The rise of a nationalist and racist figure head with a party that denies anything that isn't part of their platform without evidence.

I was a supporter of Bernie Sanders initially with his promise of universal healthcare and college loan forgiveness and a progressive agenda that I want to see. Seeing now that Biden won was the right move even though it will take longer to get to the goals I want achieved with our government and our society. It was the right move for this time. I trust Biden will put this country back on the right track. 

Donald Trump was such an embarrassment. I hope Biden will bring civility back to our politics and move us into a time of healing and actually having our government act as a governing body again with more co-operation.",t3_jptq5n,"for,historian,i,m,30,year,old,white,dude,it,s,a,beautiful,november,7th,saturday,i,just,had,lunch,and,am,smoking,some,sundae,driver,cannabis,in,a,medically,legal,state,i,am,so,thankful,to,see,this,chapter,of,american,history,is,closed,for,the,past,4,year,i,have,seen,the,country,get,split,apart,by,divisiveness,trump,ha,made,our,country,an,embarrassment,the,hate,cast,to,our,immigrant,american,of,color,and,the,lgbtq,crowd,wa,so,incredibly,sad,and,demoralizing,injustice,grew,throughout,the,country,for,anyone,not,within,the,trump,supporter,goal,trump,would,blame,entire,american,city,for,being,bad,place,because,a,democrat,wa,the,mayor,in,this,period,of,time,the,rise,of,the,alt,right,came,with,the,outspoken,science,denier,and,white,nationalist,somehow,wearing,a,fask,mask,to,protect,other,american,and,yourself,from,the,coronavirus,became,politicized,i,can,t,believe,this,is,where,we,are,coronavirus,just,went,over,120k,positive,case,rate,for,the,first,time,my,father,in,law,ha,been,in,the,hospital,for,coronavirus,for,a,week,a,of,today,he,appears,to,of,just,turned,the,corner,in,not,needing,a,ventilator,he,got,the,virus,by,going,to,a,christian,rally,that,had,2k,people,throughout,this,presidency,i,kept,wondering,if,this,is,what,pre,war,germany,looked,like,in,the,30,the,rise,of,a,nationalist,and,racist,figure,head,with,a,party,that,denies,anything,that,isn,t,part,of,their,platform,without,evidence,i,wa,a,supporter,of,bernie,sander,initially,with,his,promise,of,universal,healthcare,and,college,loan,forgiveness,and,a,progressive,agenda,that,i,want,to,see,seeing,now,that,biden,won,wa,the,right,move,even,though,it,will,take,longer,to,get,to,the,goal,i,want,achieved,with,our,government,and,our,society,it,wa,the,right,move,for,this,time,i,trust,biden,will,put,this,country,back,on,the,right,track,donald,trump,wa,such,an,embarrassment,i,hope,biden,will,bring,civility,back,to,our,politics,and,move,u,into,a,time,of,healing,and,actually,having,our,government,act,a,a,governing,body,again,with,more,co,operation"
