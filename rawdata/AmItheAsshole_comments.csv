>Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted 

Try not to downvote, please. Upvote the judgements you agree with but skip the ones you don't. We want all opinions to be heard and discussed even if you disagree with them. We're not here to circlejerk, we're here to judge whether or not people are assholes.

Also please remember to upvote posts where you think OP is the asshole. I know it feels like you're rewarding them for bad behavior, but we want assholes to make it to our front page too.

**Edit:** I'm sorry everyone, we cannot turn off downvotes. The admins have not given us that option. There's a CSS trick to hide the button, but too many people use apps for that to effectively work.

2,f0w7zwn,t3_d6xoro,"While I find this notion accurate to a degree, I've lately noticed far more OBVIOUS not-the-asshole posts. The picture painted is completely one-sided, obtuse, and it's transparent that the person posting is desperately trying to be validated or ""right"" as opposed to actually wondering if what he/she did is immoral or unethical, or just overall unbecoming.

4,f0w9vln,t3_d6xoro,I spoke at length about this topic with a seasoned Redditor. The person said that all subs eventually turn into a “circle jerk” with little to no diversity in opinion. I can’t say that I have been able to prove her wrong.,t3_d6xoro
5,f0wcmjj,t3_d6xoro,"Yeah I’ve noticed people tend to stick to the most literal interpretation of an event.

6,f0w4y4f,t3_d6xoro,">I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.

This has really become one of my main problems with the sub. Commenters are often talking about people not being ""entitled to"" any sort of kindness. That may be true, but avoiding being kind, gracious, or helpful unless it benefits you is kinda the definition of assholery.

I remember having an argument with a kid (on another sub) when he said that he was playing a sport (I think it was soccer, probably casually for gym class/PE, not a competition game), and accidentally kicked the ball and hit a girl in the head. She had a barrette in her hair was cut from it, bleeding and needed stitches. She was obviously upset that she got hurt and was crying.   

He refused to apologize because it was an accident.    

Yes, Josh, it was an accident but you can still be a decent person and apologize. Even if it wasn’t intentional, your actions caused another person injury. The least you can do is say “I’m sorry”, even if it means “I’m sorry that happened to you”.   

It was a weird bit of stubbornness where he just was fighting it so hard. Like, if he uttered the words “I’m sorry” than he’s admitting fault or something.   

Technically, yes, you don’t *have* to apologize. But socially, you *should anyway*.

13,f0whzc1,t3_d6xoro,"Two thoughts:

This subs really likes what I'm calling ""contract fetishism"". If there's an agreement, it needs to be adhered to no matter what, even if the situation changes, and even if the agreement was made in reasonable ignorance. Normal, well meaning people don't think like that in interpersonal situations. Contract fetishism is what you do to your HOA when they pass bullshit by-laws, it's not what you pull on your friend who asked to delay paying you back for movie tickets so they could afford a christmas gift for their child. 

The other thing is this sub is bizarrely hostile to feelings. People will get called an asshole for feeling a certain (often understandable way): perfectly normal fears, insecurities, and frustrations get the OP labelled as an asshole, \*even absent any actual asshole behaviour\*. Feeling insecure about your spouse spending a little extra time with someone else gets the OP called an asshole, controlling, an abuser, etc, even when they've literally done nothing and just feel bad about it. 

Whenever someone makes a post entirely about how they feel, my thought is usually ""Why are you here, you haven't done anything yet. Talk to the people involved about your feelings if appropriate; seek help from friends and family if not."" But the sub is very quick to go ""You had the bad think, you're evil and unforgivable.""",t3_d6xoro

Top Comment:
""NTA -Your house your rules""",t3_d6xoro
21,f0x11m9,t3_d6xoro,"I see the situation as the following:

* Massive **polarization** of the sub: everyone's siding with one team or another, by downvoting anyone not siding with their take on an issue.
* the sub thinking they're the **social-rules equivalent of** r/legaladvice, pretending to **judge every situation on technical aspects**, missing the global picture. Someone can be *right* and an asshole at the same time.
* the way people are phrasing their post, they are **looking for confirmation and validation**, **NOT arbitration** between two plausible outcomes (YTA/NTA). They are not describing the situation in a way that would allow both YTA/NTA to exist, which would allow everyone to make their own judgement.

Instead we're seeing people framing the situation and immediately pleading their case in the same post, leaving users to decide which values/ideals they prefer to shoehorn this into the conversation and push for it, instead of weighting in the set of facts provided by the OP to determine if they are the asshole or not.

Example:

* OP post: ""a friend came to my house and brought along one of their friend. I planned to have pizza and beer, but the friend-of-friend is vegetarian and complained that I hadn't made something for them, even if I did not know they were coming. I then refused to cook a new meal or drive out to get something for them: if they wanted a special meal, they should have asked beforehand or brought their own. My friend is now upset with me and say I wasn't nice with their friend.""
* Actual situation: friend of friend came along, saw that there were only meat-based pizzas, politely asked if there was something else in the fridge or pantry, so that they could make their own meal or just eat a small leftover with them. OP got mad the new person ""ruined"" their pizza party, saw that as an outrage, when it could have just been a ""oh sure, there's some \[...\] in the fridge, or you could get some \[...\] from this cupboard, would it be ok for you?""
* Users end up spamming ""NTA, Your home, Your rules"", ""Who brings a stranger along without warning? ew how rude"", ""Being vegetarian is their choice, not yours!"", **not actually arbitrating the situation** \- *how much one should accommodate for unexpected guests* \- and instead validating OP for being... A grumpy host, potentially a mild asshole.

It's been a while since I saw a good AITA post, where OP was *genuinely* conflicted between two possible interpretations of a situation.

*PS: I may have been guilty of that previously, so I'm glad this thread brought it up - from now on, I'll try to remember to avoid these behaviors when participating.*",t3_d6xoro
22,f0w5q7x,t3_d6xoro,"This sub has kinda lost its purpose in that it’s become “am I technically in the wrong here,” when in reality one of the most common forms of asshole behavior is when somebody is “technically correct” but not taking other people’s feelings into account.

Also the amount of anti-child rhetoric is insane here, and I’m shocked by how many people seem to believe that if a guy has unprotected sex with a woman but doesn’t want a baby, she should be forced to have an abortion or raise it on her own.",t3_d6xoro
23,f0wciqr,t3_d6xoro,"Don't forget about the revenge posts. Most people on this sub believe that two wrongs actually do make a right. All of the well thought out ESH posts get downvoted to oblivion.

People forget that there are much more ways to maturely handle these situations.",t3_d6xoro
24,f0we1af,t3_d6xoro,"My biggest problem with this sub is that people take the ""eye for an eye"" philosophy way to often. Can't tell you how many times I've seen where someone was technically in the right in their situation but they let their emotions get the better of them and say or do something that is assholish. Yet everyone on here is like ""NTA They deserved it"". That's not how the real world or morality works (at least not how it should work). For example, if your boyfriend gets jealous and tries to control you from going out with your friends cause he doesn't like now nice your male coworker treats you and you respond by telling him he has a tiny penis and that you're going to go cheat on him, that makes you an asshole to.

29,f0wb0lb,t3_d6xoro,"I think it's also worth noting that the current voting system's binary asshole / not asshole states promotes extreme responses -- you can not be an asshole but still have been rude, and the community response to rudeness is very inconsistent.  Sometimes the bar is so low that mild rudeness on the other party's part will cause people to be angry if you vote YTA instead of ESH.  Sometimes the bar is so high that no level of rudeness will get YTA votes.  And the early comments and up/down votes will always skew the conversation -- even ""score hidden"" doesn't help, since it doesn't change where the comments end up or if the comments are minimized.

Reddit is skews way way way more ""I should be able to do whatever I want with no social consequences"" than any other social group I've interacted with.  If people don't remember that when taking their ruling in to account they're going to run in to a lot of problems.",t3_d6xoro
30,f0w668a,t3_d6xoro,"This is a really important point, and I'm glad someone's making it. A good example from the last 24 hours would be [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d6w9vq/wibta_if_i_told_my_inlaws_to_plan_and_pay_for_my/), where OP and his fiancee don't want a wedding reception, but his in-laws do, so he's wondering if he'd be TA if he ""told them that if they wanted the wedding reception so badly they should just plan and pay for it themselves.""

There's no disputing the fact that they don't have to have a reception if they don't want one, and OP's in-laws should stop pressuring them, which is what the vast majority of commenters are saying. But handling the situation the way OP proposes would, in the real world, result in unnecessary pain and anguish for two people OP should be forging an amicable bond with. He'd absolutely be sabotaging the future happiness of all concerned, including himself, if he spoke to his future in-laws this way before he's even married their daughter.

I'm not having a go at OP - he [responded to my suggestion in a really mature way.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d6w9vq/wibta_if_i_told_my_inlaws_to_plan_and_pay_for_my/f0vykz3/) But I wish commenters would think things through before advising people to dump their spouses or cut off their parents. Just because you technically have a *right* to do something doesn't mean it's a *good* thing to do. And in the real world - in relationships with family, friends, significant others, or the community at large - we do have to make decisions that preserve and build positive relationships, rather than getting what we think we deserve and leaving those relationships in ruins.

People are going to think you're an asshole if you put someone in danger - even if they're a terrible person.


Any dissension here is downvoted.  That's just a silly reddit thing but I think it is indicative of a larger refusal to examine your arguments or behavior and selfishness. It's easy to dehumanize the party you cant see or hear from in these posts.

Everyone who shows up here had a question about whether their behavior was acceptable.  You don't generally have those questions unless there is *something* you could have done differently.

I tend to not comment for fear of down vote oblivion, the same reason a lot of people don't. 

But these need to be morality based judgments not legality. There's other subs for that. 

Most of these could easily be ESH instead of NTA. I don't care what he/she did, you were not ""justified"" in yelling/screaming/mocking and calling them fat/jealous/ugly/stupid.

58,f0wj098,t3_d6xoro,"I think the issue is the distinction between ethics and etiquette. There are plenty of things that aren't ethically wrong (not holding the door for someone, or taking the last cookie), but still go against common etiquette.

The discussions on this thread tend to lean heavily toward what is, or isn't, ethical. And I think that's fine. First, because the sub's description explicitly calls it ""a catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us"" (indicating a preference for ethics). Second, because matters of etiquette don't really elicit discussion in the same way ethics do. Etiquette is a set of rules that exists primarily to streamline our daily interactions. The rules are (mostly) arbitrary, frequently antiquated, and vary drastically based on region, upbringing, and age. Ethics, on the other hand is typically based on moral principles and rational argument. It is much more interesting to have a discussion about correct moral principles, or what line of reasoning connects a particular action to a particular moral principle than it is to have a discussion about what Emily Post says about holding doors.

In real life, ethics and etiquette come into conflict pretty frequently. Etiquette says; ""stand up for that old person,"" or ""let that kid have the last cookie,"" while ethics says ""your sore back isn't less important than that elderly man's sore hip, and if he needs the seat, he can ask,"" and ""You're not responsible for the happiness of random strangers' kids.""

As these examples show, ethics can sometimes come off as cold or aloof because it doesn't put the same emphasis on being nice or appearing compassionate as etiquette does. But ultimately, most of us want to be moral people and well liked. But if I have to choose between being a moral person, and being liked, I'll choose being moral 100% of the time.",t3_d6xoro

64,f0wfkbw,t3_d6xoro,"COUNTERPOINT: I read and can see OP's point of view. I have another view. Spurred on by the Internet, a lot of people previously silenced are finding their voices and finding that other people are like them, have the same experiences, and can talk to them. Women who submitted to abusive men can now read about signs of abuse and can find resources more easily than ever before. They may never have even heard that it's OK to leave, or know how to do it. Certainly nothing their extended family said--they told her ""just be a good wife,"" or ""God made the man the head of the household,"" or ""well, what did you do to make him mad?"" Sadly, abusers have a lot of willing enablers in many families, ""for the sake of family peace.""

Transgender issues are now being openly discussed. When I was a teen in the 1980s, NO ONE even talked about being GAY, much less trans. One of my high school friends has come out as gay DECADES after that time--it's nothing she could have said at the time. This kind of thing is true for \*many\* older Gen-Xers, much less Boomers. Think about the rigid gender roles of the 1950s. Many older people you know had to deal with that. Women couldn't even get checking accounts until the 1970s!  

So to sum up, sometimes the individualistic replies you see here represent people previously silenced who can now say something. Like the childfree unenthusiastic about babysitting. Reasonable people can disagree about whether they should be thought of as assholes or not to spend time taking care of other people's children, but it was a given that they would cheerfully do so in days gone by. Not any more--""childfree"" is a lexicalized status now, even, in contrast to the ""barren"" or ""unhappy bachelor"" of years gone by. New concept, new voices.

Or ""it's her body"" replies that seem to simplify an issue. There's so much baggage behind this one, and so much pain, that I can forgive someone reflexively defaulting to ""it's her body"" when it's a tattoo someone's partner dislikes. Assholish? Debatable--the point is that she didn't even have choices about her own body for much of American history. If the response is a little strident this time, it's understandable, to me at least.

73,f0whk2w,t3_d6xoro,"What ""value system"" aligns with the rest of the world? 

All value systems are subjective. All of your examples are your subjective view on what is or is not an asshole behaviour. Not everyone is going to agree with your views. 

You're essentially banging a drum with your post and saying there's an issue with people being allowed to express their views on what is or is not asshole behaviour that goes against some sort of world/universal standard, as if there is a universal standard we all agree on, when there isn't one, and people giving their subjective views reflecting their value systems should not be seen as an issue, in my opinion. 

For instance:

> People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes. 

The complete opposite can also be true: people who value individualism and don't put stock in collectivism may consider the collectivists to be assholes.

Or in the case of your examples: there are circumstances in those scenarios where people would not be an asshole for doing what you describe as asshole behaviour - circumstances, and nuance, matter.

However, you do raise a point with respect to the hive mind trends we can see in posts and responses, and I've seen it go both ways (some threads there is say a collectivist response that is highly voted and the opposing individualistic take is downvoted, or vice versa).

I think that is more concerning than the fact that there are such diverse perspectives on what is or isn't asshole behaviour - as when the hive mind occurs it can stifle people from commenting and adding to a diverse discussion. Perhaps the period in which comments are randomized is not long enough? 

Or perhaps, on accepting judgment, we realize that while we can accept them all, not all judgments ought to be weighted the same: if someone gives a judgment but offers zero reasoning or is unwilling to back it up, well, I wouldn't put much weight on their judgement. 

But how we weight judgments and the ones we choose to give power to are individual choices that the poster will make. This kind of bucks the ""X judgment is popular therefore X judgment is correct"" - as if the popularity of a judgment makes it more correct than others (that's fallacious and illogical, but since it is often assumed it creates the kind of hive mind trend we see and bitch about).",t3_d6xoro

It was very revealing and he felt it wasn't appropriate. 90% of the time, if you're greeted by someone wearing practically nothing at the door, it's going to make you uncomfortable, especially if you don't know them that well.

Not because you are a prude or because you want to sleep with the person, but there is a social expectation that people will cover up to a degree of decency around visitors or strangers. There are few people who would wander around in revealing underwear around their roommate's boyfriend. Some may even get the wrong idea (or perhaps even the right one). The sub shat all over the guy for being concerned when a boyfriend hanging out with another scantily clad woman would have branded him the asshole for being okay with it, especially if his girlfriend was concerned.

Not only is the sub incredibly liberal when it comes to individualism, it uses the downvote as a disagree button. Women also tend to get a lot more leeway before they're called assholes while men tend to have to go above and beyond to prove there was no asshole intent.

In these situations I think society's values are misaligned and this sub is more objective.

The easiest examples are when you're expected or asked to give up or swap a seat on public transportation or any public place. Most of the time if you say no everybody thinks you're an asshole but none of those people are stepping up to offer their spot, they're just judging you while being secretly thankful it's not them. 

It's the same behavior seen in outrage waves or mobs. How many people that pile on somebody are just as or more guilty and really just glad the focus is elsewhere?

90,f0wgjii,t3_d6xoro,"I've been lurking on this sub for a month and this is what I've observed.

You generally get two types of popular posts here: validation posts where the OP is clearly NTA by any measure of common decency and seek to just be confirmed by the crowd, or morally obtuse OPs who are clearly TA, but want to argue that they are right. Rare is it that someone is humble enough to be genuinely open to the crowd's judgment. Honestly, this should be expected given the nature of the sub. It's human nature to be defensive rather than humble, and since all we have usually is the word of the OP, we can expect the narratives to be tilted in OP's favor.

I think the reason why judgments are often not perhaps in line with how the rest of society might decide is due to two reasons. One is that most of the clear-cut cases involve abuse, manipulation, or gross inconsideration of either the OP (or, in the case where OP is TA, the victim)'s rights. The sub appears to be weighted toward a thorough, even extreme, individualism in which individual rights and choices are nearly absolute so long as it follows the law.\* This individualism is a good model to apply when obvious rights are being violated, and the kind of people who are genuinely hurt and wondering if they're TA are the type who have trouble asserting themselves appropriately. They need more individualism and boundary-setting.

Life, however, is often more complicated than those cases. There are many instances in a failing marriage, for instance, where both sides can take some blame. I've seen this happen in real life more than once, where one can make equally plausible cases for either partner being more of a jerk than the other. It's actually relatively rare for the ""right"" side to be perfectly obvious. But those posts usually don't get tons of upvotes, even though we have a label for it (ESH).

The second is related to Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations theory (which [the Vice article](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/3kxkd3/am-i-the-asshole-reddit) that examined the survey of the sub touched on). The majority of the sub is liberal in political and social orientation. According to Haidt, those with liberal views tend to emphasize ""fairness/reciprocity"" and ""harm/care"" as the two central poles of morality. This is very compatible with a focus on individual rights, and the most popular posts tend to center around clear violations of fairness and/or obvious harm. However, conservatives tend to not only take fairness and harm into account but also ""purity,"" ""ingroup-loyalty,"" and ""authority."" This sub frequently sides against views that privilege these three factors, particularly ingroup-loyalty, based on how swift people are to advise cutting the offenders off completely, even if they are family, spouse, or longtime friends. ""Purity"" is criticized as being oppressive, and ""authority"" is usually suspect unless it agrees with the posters' views.

(A really good example is the recent locked post by the absentee biological father who insisted on being the only one to walk his daughter down the aisle. His appeal was almost exclusively centered around purity and in-group loyalty, which the vast majority of posters—myself included—found deeply repulsive. However, in many conservative cultures, his argument makes perfect sense, and is in fact related to the foundation of their traditional sexual morality. His view was blatantly patriarchal in a way that's scandalous to most modern people, but there are many places in the world where that view is not only mainstream, but strictly enforced by society and religion. That certainly doesn't make it right, but it does explain why such views even exist and when encountered seem so foreign and offensive.)

In the outside world, where there is still a mix of liberals and conservatives (one often dominating regions over the other), you're going to have more people who take the other 3 moral foundations into account. Haidt believes that this is a large part of the polarization of the country, because the two orientations are often incompatible with one another. When moral consensus begins to fade, you will inevitably get conflict. Here, though, there's actually a pretty thorough moral consensus, centered around individual rights and freedoms. Hence the seeming uniformity of the sub.

One last comment. I grew up in a conservative church where it was constantly bemoaned that society had fallen to ""moral relativism"" when the Bible said that morality was absolute. I never thought that was an adequate explanation for life's complexities. Now, however, it seems that black and white morality is back in fashion. Judgments here and elsewhere are often unnuanced, absolute, and sweeping. Perhaps we need a little more ""relativism"" to balance the scales again.

^(\*Major exception: adultery, where there is an absolute and unequivocal condemnation in nearly all circumstances and little to no sympathy for the participants. It seems nearly no punishment short of death is unapproved for cheating here. This is a big change from my youth, when many people wanted to give Bill Clinton a pass for his adultery and subsequent attempts to cover it up. He would not get away with it now.)",t3_d6xoro

Most of the time when I comment on this sub I end up getting some overly aggressive person ranting at me for what J say.

Have that happen 5 times in a row and see if you want to comment or post again. So what do we do? Just go to another sub.

So the dicks get more support for what they are pushing and the reasonable people leave one by one, eventually the sub just becomes a toxic hell hole.

That being said, even by the most fundamental of American legal values I feel so many posters easily satisfy that asshole bar--by infringing on a very basic principle of freedom by taking away from them an indispensable sense of comfort or control over their own environment. To everyone who ends up saying something along the lines of ""NTA, you don't owe anyone anything"": hell yes you do.

You owe them respect, personal space, the right to exercise their agency freely. You owe them your assistance (upon request and/or if they genuinely are in need of said assistance) if it doesn't moderately inconvenience you. You owe them polite, appropriate responses, even when they're assholes themselves--being the better person doesn't make you a doormat; if you want to make a point, clearly assert the point. You don't stoop to their level (or lower). Violent or hurtful retaliation should never be your immediate response, it's the very, very last resort, if all else--and I mean everything else, even seeking mediation from authority of which I myself am not the biggest fan--fails. You owe them manners, something which is incredibly understated in this sub. *You owe people general kindness and compassion by default*.

Hell, even good people who don't engage in such behaviors can still get caught up in group-think or fall for BS one-sided stories. 

We as a society need LOT more caution in reading people's stories. Y'all talk about fake news or whatever, yet YOU KEEP FALLING FOR IT! Never forget, folks: **You are reading ONE side of the story**. 

And I can guarantee you 90% of the stories here are one-sided BS. Folks leaving out key details or victimizing themselves. That's the human condition, no one wants to believe their own shit stinks. 

If you wanna be better at weeding out BS, then watch for these:

\-Vagueness or unwillingness to share details.

\-Not responding to any questions or INFO requests.

\-Responding in a way that's less ""nice"" than the original post.

\-Inconsistent details or actions, they say one thing but then do another.

\-Badmouthing friends or family. Seriously, does it not strike you as odd that, instead of talking a thing out with their alleged best friend, they chose to come here and talk shit instead?

\-Constant use of ""I I I I"" or ""my my my my"" or ""me me me me.""

That last tip is a personal favorite. In fact, challenge for you: Look up various popular AITA posts and count how many paragraphs start with ""I."" You will be *blown away* by just how often people talk about themselves. And that's yet another tell-tale sign that you got a one-sided story.

I do agree on some level that a lot of the sentiments are sometimes painted as VERY one sided but there are also some posts that try overly hard to give a lot of context, which can be helpful. 

But really, I disagree because while ""yes, it doesn't cost much to extend common courtesy to others,"" people also tend to still think you're an asshole for not completely giving into when sometimes people just don't want to and this sub can also turn very hard on those people as well. \[It's not AS frequent but ignoring that it does happen is a bit of an oversight.\] You can consider someone's side but still want to go your own way and people can judge that just as harshly because when you consider it should somehow make you overly empathetic when people have things going on in their own lives sometimes that isn't stated \[which we all agree with, when we note how ""one-sided"" posts can be. Not everyone wants to lay out all of what they're dealing when they choose to say ""no"" to someone.\]

At what point is not wanting to constant being infringed upon okay? \[Like the thread about OP's roommate that had a food problem and people where SO angry at the OP for not wanting to indefinitely change their lifestyle for someone because no where in the post did the OP note how long this other person would have needed to change their behaviour in their own home.\] This subs loves to talk about ""boundaries"" but rarely in the instances when people just don't want to have to always put out for someone else.

There's a lot wrong with this post, but I think the highlight is ""more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation"". This is true, but irrelevant. People in the real world suck - they brainwash their children selfish beliefs, they're abusive, they give special treatment to attractive people, they're selfish, they're rude to people in the service industry, they litter - we know this, which is why we come here to get a broader more enlightened perspective.

I was on board at the start - because it's true this place, like any particular 'place' will be an echo chamber to some degree, and it's good to remember that - but the post ends up coming off like a claim that the the perspectives here are somehow not applicable to the real world. Well, they might not be perfect, but if the goal is as close to objective moral/ethical perfection as possible and the true answer is ""3"", I would say Reddit's ""2"" is better advice and worth following even if the real world around you is pushing for ""0"".

No, I'm not an asshole for not going out for drinks with my co-workers once in a while. The ""real world"" might disagree because it's selfish, but that's farther from the objective moral/ethical truth than ""no I'm not"". I found myself in a world of 9-5 with a lot of hobbies/interests/draws waiting for me as soon as I leave the building I'm only in to pay rent, and I would be treating myself unfairly, making a mistake to ignore those things more than I already have to for countless other reasons.

 Take the poster who had racist parents although he wasn't racist himself. They didn't want their daughter to bring a POC (Jamal) to them, because it would cause a huge issue during the entire visit. 

 To me that's understandable. Especially when you don't see someone once every so often. 

 I could see it being a bigger issue if his daughter was married. The parent was just trying to keep the peace for parents he hasn't seen, and it's totally okay to do that.

 I've been in the same situation that Jamal is in while dating someone of different racial, cultural, religious, and financial backgrounds. (I'm mixed race.) 

 There were many times my GF at the time told me I couldn't go visit her since so or so was visiting, because it would cause drama. It wasn't a big deal, and I told her to just enjoy herself. 
 
 It took time, but 90% of them warmed up to me, but there is always going to be that 10% who will find any reason to hate you. 

 One time three cousins started ruining a dinner with 12 people. It was getting heated, and so I smiled, thanked both parents for the meal, and excused myself. 

 Why? Since the last thing I would want to do is cause drama or external problems with the person I am falling for. I wasn't married, and it's not my place to cause issues in someone else's home by being there. I wasn't family, but just some random guy. 

 The only thing I care about in any relationship is wether I make the persons life better or make them happy. That is it - I don't want to cause a rift between everyone. 

 Also since when it is it acceptable to bring someone home who will cause issues? Racism and prejudice suck, but you won't fix it within a week. It's better as the SO to just really understand these things, and focus on what's best for the person you love.

That probably plays a part, but please don't forget the difference in knowledge between people offline and people online. In a relationship (friends, romantic, family, what have you) where people talk about the issue at hand a lot, that might be a different story, but some of your public examples (bus, etc.) include lots of onlookers who are likely to have no knowledge about OP's inner workings at all.

On this sub, you get to read the thought process behind (and lead-up to) what happened. In real life, people see what's happening and judge based on that - in some cases, not all.

When he asked her to move, she declined, and when he eventually got fed up enough to tell one of the workers on the flight, the woman who declined her seat was forced to sit back up but she called the man an asshole. The part that gets me was that one of the most upvoted and popular comments on that post claimed that he knew he was tall and that it would be an issue so he should’ve either found a different (such as 1st class) seat, dealt with it, or just not flown.

Like what the hell? This woman made another person very uncomfortable for a mid length flight just to make herself slightly more comfortable. How is that ok in any capacity? You are not allowed to infringe in another person for your own gain, like, ever!

And really category is the wrong word, its more of a spectrum. The neutral category definitely doesn't fall under nice/courteous, but it doesn't quite fall under asshole either. I see a lot of situations where where people asking for judgement could fairly easily handle the situation slightly better and would fall into clear ""nice""/definitely NOT asshole territory, but the way they handled it/are wanting to handle it is much further over in the ""neutral""/leaning towards asshole. Basically, I'm not willing to vote YTA just because someone isn't doing the ""nice"" thing. 

In my opinion, given that this sub is called ""Am I the asshole,"" its not fair to judge someone as the asshole if they aren't at least REALLY toeing the asshole line.

My eyebrows shot right up when you spoke of collectivism in a positive light. What?! Just taking for granted that nearly everyone thinks collectivism is good? That's a bit out of touch with reality, no?

Then I get to the end and find you describe the general culture in this sub as individualistic? I mean, are you trolling? Trying to be TA on purpose to make a point?

I agree that when an unpopular opinion gets berated and massively downvoted not many will want to state their disagreement, thus kind of defeating the point of the sub. This has happened to me a couple of times and I'll get DMs from people who secretly agree, but dont want to state their agreement in the thread because they dont want to get caught up in that shit storm.

But, then again, I'm an individualist who thinks collectivism is an evil ideology and am horrified that anyone would associate the judgements in this sub with anything individualistic in any way — so according to your thesis I guess I dont really exist at all IRL.

I want to end by reiterating my agreement, however. The more this becomes an echo chamber the more the main point, as I understand it, of this sub fades away. Maybe the solution is to promote the idea that people should actually follow the guide lines of the sub; read and follow the rules. I mean, if all the judgements were in tune with your own and of those you know personally — wouldn't that start to resemble an echo chamber?

I'd encourage everyone to actually read the rules and guidelines and stick to them.

PS: Apologies for the sarcasm, it just got stuck under my skin — taking for granted that nearly everyone agrees that anyone who thinks collectivism isn't good (me) are assholes, then claiming that the general culture in this sub is individualistic when I've had so much shit dumped on me here for my individualistic views... well it got under my skin. I can actually feel the annoyed resentment prickling under my skin.

i wonder if part of this is being inherently biased towards the person posting because you have their full context and thought process.

like if i said ""AITA for refusing to give up my seat for elderly person?"", then describe that i'm autistic with balance issues, i will fall over if i don't have somewhere to sit, and that means that if i give up my seat i will have to get off and wait for another bus, then people would probably say i am not being an asshole even if i append that with ""and i don't want to have to get into a long explanation that people may not even believe every time i ride the bus."" 

however people offline see a relatively young person with no obvious injuries or health issues and comfortably say i'm the asshole.

combine this with a lot of times that people are percieved as an asshole not necessarily for *what* they did, but *how* they did it. we are getting an inherently biased account of how the other people did things, espicially if op had strong feelings in this situation that are clouding their memory. like maybe when someone asks me to give up my seat i'm already feeling nervous and defensive because i'm remembering all the times people didn't take my disabilities seriously until they had to fill out an accident report, so then i perceive them as being much more aggressive than they actually were. however my biased perspective is what makes it into the post, earning me a NTA (and the other person is).",t3_d6xoro

It seems that a lot of times, the rubric for judging if someone is an asshole is ""are they obligated to do the thing everybody is demanding they do?"" If the answer is no then OP gets voted NTA. Meanwhile, in the real world, a person that only does what they're obligated to and lets other people struggle/suffer in the process  would be labeled selfish at best and an asshole at worst. 

You said it wonderfully. In the real world we live as a collective group. You help out your family and neighbors because it's what kind people do. Look, if you don't want to carpool with Bob because his breath stinks and you haven't told anyone you're pregnant, that's fine. Give yourself some slack, you're not an asshole. Even if you're not pregnant and you just don't like the idea of being alone with Bob. Again, that's your prerogative. But just understand that every day you have to face the people in the real world that might think it was selfish of you while the people that think you're 100% justified will never see you because they live thousands of miles away and judged you via the internet.

It'd be nice if answers were to elaborate on this. For example ""NTA, however, your SO's family might think you're selfish because to them you're abandoning them during christmas dinner.

The following statement could be applied to all of Reddit:

>Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.


You can draw several conclusions from this. First of all, reddit is no longer a good place for discourse. There's just too many people on the platform, and the structure of said platform encourages popular opinions, bandwagoning, and extremism, simply because of the way upvotes work. As I said, the chance of my post being seen by a sizeable amount of people is just microscopic. It's been 4 hours, and there are already 2.8k comments.

The other, in my opinion, important conclusion is the way reddit as a platform impacts the real world. Reddit is massively influential, and it's been proven that the dialogue that occurs can be controlled by bots and an overarching agenda over and over again. When a post on r/aita reaches the front page, and said post doesn't align with reality, this post is now altering the reality and rationality of thousands of people. You said:

>out of step with how people in the real world judge situations

The terrifying thing is, for many people, they will now judge real world situations by these completely alien metrics. I'm talking, if it wasn't clear, about politics, but really, this extends far beyond that. There are serious sociological impacts that are occuring before our very eyes as to how social media impacts real world situations and global politics.

I'm not sure if it's possible to be an unbiased narrator in your own stories. Also, you can't possibly add all of the context needed for every story.

Combine that with the fact that the OP has a motivation to skew the story they're telling to benefit themselves. In the end you get a subjective ""judgment"" on a 50-60% legitimately true post, which amounts to jack shit. 

Also we are all literally passing judgment on a term that isn't defined.  What constitutes ""asshole"" behavior varies wildly from person to person, except in extreme circumstances. Plus the potential judgments lack nuance. You have some posts that have tons of moving parts and points where OP is barely an asshole/not an asshole. Yet the limited voting options completely remove all of that and we are just left with asshole/not asshole.

So why pretend any of the judgments rendered here have any real merit? Just read for the shits and gigs and give your opinion when you feel like it.

The sister with the smaller room asked to keep some things in the other sister’s room since she had ample space (because 900 sq ft is the size of a tiny home!). The OP made a big deal about her sister needing to come into her room to retrieve things, and if it became a problem she would throw her things out. She took it to her parents who clearly didn’t want to deal with that mess and told her she was going to ruin her relationship with her sister.

395,f0xmhwi,t3_d6xoro,"Yeah! There was one on here maybe a month ago where a girl was like 18 years old had a two year old daughter ( obv was a teen pregnancy) and her older sister (like 26)  never wanted to help her with the kid and she doesn’t like kids and doesn’t want them herself. (There was some subtle hints that older sis was mad cus younger sis had baby young and the parents now have to help) Apparently younger sis leaves her kid with older sis cus mom (grandma) was at store and older sis very reluctantly agrees to watch her niece for the few minutes that their mom would be gone at store. And turns out baby has to be rushed to emergency like not even 10/20 min after leaving her kid with older sis 
 
Everyone on here was saying young mom was the asshole for blaming sis for the accident. Some moms even chimed in and said well they do get away from you fast and blah blah  (I understand accidents can happen but geez within minutes of her watching child?!) and that “ she did tell you she was uncomfortable watching kids” like wtf!! I do not want kids  I hate watching them myself but I’m sorry when I’ve been put in similar situations I’ll watch the hell out of those kids BECAUSE of scary incidents that can happen like this in an instant. 

Now maybe she wasn’t to blame directly (although I was getting some sociopathic vibes myself since she was never okay with her sister bringing her child around and hated the parents babysat but that’s a whole different discussion) but yes I’m sorry you are gonna get blamed in the  heat of the moment! It’s just natural and yeah that can be seen as asshole but how ppl were explaining the YTA was even worse because “well your sister did tell you she wasn’t comfortable watching kids” 

Like are we fuckin serious?? It’s your  niece!! And the mom (grandma) was going to come back within like 20 min tops wasn’t like she had to watch her the whole day! That one weirded me the fuck out cus we’re talking about a baby here and whether we want them or like them if any family member brings children around you idk why naturally as humans your guard shouldn’t  be up for them.  They’re just learning things and are figuring stuff out. To me it honestly sounded like the sister just let the little girl do what she wanted and was like ah idk what to do with these things whatever I’ll just let her do what she wants since it seems like she knows what she’s doing

I've felt there should be a new response like, ""You're The Asshole But Justified"" or something similar. 

Years ago I spent some time thinking about some actions I make or stances I take in certain situations I find myself in and decided that sometimes I'm an asshole when involving (what I consider) unrealistic social norms.

I've been pondering it for the last 6 months because just about every judgment has been one that wouldn't fly in the real world. Is it that reddit skews toward younger posters? Maybe they just haven't grown up enough to fully understand empathy? I know that when you're young it's sometimes hard to see the world from someone else's perspective. Or has the world just changed so much that every care towards how someone else feels has gone out the window?

THANK YOU.

So many examples of people on here with the same sentiment of ""I'm not an asshole because I technically am not required to do / not do X"" ... just because there's no law against something, they've decided it's not asshole behavior.

Case in point, the discussion on ""seat reclining"" threads, so many people get huffy at the idea that reclining a seat onto a tall person's legs is asshole behavior.  Yes, you paid for the seat... SO WHAT? Hurting other people without an excellent reason makes you ... An asshole! Yes it does!  Whether you paid for the privilege or not! Wow!

I got downvoted to hell for saying the guy who took the blueberry pie instead of letting the little girl have it was an asshole.  ""He was in line first"" was the reasoning.  Really? Being in line means you're not a mean person?

That's cool. I think they're assholes for assuming I should have to sacrifice something that make my day suck a little less just because a kid wants it. I'm really confused about why people think being a child makes you more entitled to sweets than the adult who was in line first. People love to hate on us ""child-free"" folks who supposedly hate children. I don't hate the kids. I hate when parents think I owe their kids something JUST because they're kids. If that makes me the asshole, so be it. The simple fact is, there's always going to be a group of people who are going to think you're an asshole regardless of what action you take. So yeah, someone might say ""you're an asshole for purchasing the last cookie and now my kid is crying"", I'm going to think they're the asshole for not simply explaining to the kid that you don't always get what you want in life and instead treating a stranger like they owe you something when, in reality, you have no idea why the person was buying said cookie. Maybe they were buying it for THEIR kid. Who knows. The reality is, when you become a parent, you knowingly sign up to making sacrifices in terms of your personal happiness for that child. The rest of the world didn't.

Should I as a stranger go out of my way to stop a kid from doing something that would hurt them? Absolutely. I can reprimand you for not watching your child later, but keeping them from harm is important. I WOULD be the asshole for not helping in that situation. THAT is the ""it takes a village"" mentality, not being willing to sacrifice getting something like a cookie just because your kid wants it.

Reddit isn't composed of people who only exist within its spaces. People here *are* real people, and more importantly, we're impartial third parties. The same people who might find you an asshole in real life aren't going to magically declare you NTA when they're on reddit.

I think when people read these posts they see themselves in the OP and want to justify the OP's actions in order to also justify their own. We all have a justification for why we're being TA. No one does anything without having some kind of reason for it, but you're totally right. Just because we have what seems like a valid reason doesn't make it any less shitty to those around us.

I especially liked your point about the discourse favoring selfish or individualistic behavior. In real life no one would be okay with the positions you referenced above because in a public setting those behaviors aren't viewed as acceptable. But when one person describes their shitty behavior on this sub to a bunch of other individuals it's like we see ourselves in the OP and we side with them on an individual level. But you're so right. If we were actually there in the moment or in the crowd we'd think very differently. Being on the computer allows us to be even more individualistic than when we're in public.

567,f0wkj6o,t3_d6xoro,"Actually nobody is forcing people to vote with the most popular ones - the popular ones may truly represent the values of those who are prepared to engage in online forums. Personally I tend to agree with about 70% of most popular conclusions. Sometimes a viewpoint is popular and lots of people will support it and hate those who argue against - these are charged situations that people may well recognise in their own lives or in those of their family or friends.

Certainly this sub represents western values, those who raise queries concerning family obligation aspects don't go down well when the parents are AH to their children. I'm not saying that's wrong - I'd subscribe to that viewpoint myself - but it doesn't represent how the wider society they live in may  then view those children if the families are not in a western society but in another country which has a hierarchical obligated family ethos being valued.

In fact I think I'd disagree with this OP as sometimes being polite and considerate in a particular set-up is being a doormat or a polite considered reply to certain circumstances simply won't cut it and I don't think that not being ultra-polite or occasionally looking after your own interests first makes you an AH. Life is not being a super polite soul who always puts other people first otherwise you're definitely an AH. Context is SO important - the number of posts where I've read the title and it sounds like the OP must be TA but when you read about their problem in it's context then you think ""ah no, this is complicated and I don't blame them in these circumstances..."".  Some responses have a lot of people thinking ""justified AH"". 

A little consideration is one thing and that isn't always valued in the sub. 

The other thing I sometimes worry about is the speed with which people will *totally* cut others out of their life. I think that tactic started as a necessary evil to defend people against extremely toxic people - it wasn't called 'ghosting' or 'cutting out' but everyone as old as I am will know people who slowly lost touch with each other or had the experience of what is now called 'ghosting' but you just didn't talk about it then and it was expected. But talking about this tactic seems to have spread it possibly a little more than is warranted. If you're having a family dispute it doesn't mean you can't work through it.

One thing this sub is red hot on is cheating - nasty and wrong but this sub would treat cheaters like serial murderers, even on the first instance. But I think that's a reflection of wider society which has got very intolerant about this. It may be painful and impossible for a good number of couples to come back from. But some people manage to work through it and come out stronger but anyone doing that now is the object of scorn.",t3_d6xoro

I don't think it's up there at 50% wrong from what people in real life would say, I see a mix of answers with pros and cons and people generally do split hard decisions pretty evenly and make their cases. 

If anything this sub focuses too much on technicalities that let you avoid calling yourself an asshole when in reality you're being one. Also, sometimes, you are the asshole but people here tell you that you're not because even if you were being an asshole you had the right to do so which somehow negates the being an asshole.

While Gabe's theory focused on anonymity, I believe the problem is consequences. People say shit on social media, regardless of the fact that their real name is attached to their words, that they would never say to a person face-to-face. The difference is that they don't see the immediate reaction to their words on social media, and it is easier to characterize any online detractors as less-than-real people.

Giving advise to strangers on social media compounds the problem, as the adviser will not experience the consequences of their advice in any way (except for a possible UPDATE post).

636,f0wo2ay,t3_d6xoro,"Thank you for posting this, it needed to be said, it's been getting worse lately.

A classic example I remember was when there was a table of college aged kids talking loudly and graphically about sucking dicks in a family restaurant, next to OPs table where they had their young kid and some of their kid's friends. She went over to the table and politely asked them to stop, and they did, it was all fine.

The amount of responses saying ""I shouldn't have to police how I talk just because you decided to bring your kids out"" and calling her the asshole for the interaction was unbelievable. I got loads of downvotes, as did others, for suggesting that maybe a family restaurant at lunchtime in the presence of children wasn't the best place to have that sort of drunken conversation, and that OP actually handled it quite well.

There should be a list of banned arguments/phrases like ""technically"", ""you have the right to"" and the idea that some wrongdoing on someone else's part means any reaction from the OP was completely justified.

I understand this sort of thing often happens when subs get larger, but there are strategies mods could test out to deal with it.",t3_d6xoro

This is all fine. But to me, looking in, this sub seems like a place for young people (probably majority without kids) to encourage each other.

It's also become victim to reductive arguments that are both absurd and condescending.

662,f0wph1p,t3_d6xoro,"I think the sub is bound to not be objective first of all because most people have issue with self-awareness and trying to not relate or imagine themselves in a situation which will make their answers ultimately biased but also mostly because nobody can really judge if a person is being an asshole or not when the post is written by the person who lived the experience. It's really easy to influence how the results are gonna come up with the way you'll write your post, you're gonna put emphasis on certain things if you want people to tell you you were the asshole or not. It can be conscious but also unconscious. Basically if you think you were the asshole in the situation, you're gonna talk about it like you were and if you think you weren't you'll disclose a lot of information that'll justify your actions put not necessarily everything that's in favor of the opposite party.

It's not inherently wrong because some people (most people actually in my opinion) can probably see through the shit and some times point out that ""dude you were still an asshole"" but it riggs the answer. For example I've seen two different post about a guy getting into an argument with their gf/love interest and the question was ""AITA for doing that thing ?"" that was an obvious no when they completely lashed out at their girlfriend when they reacted slightly badly. Like no dude you're not an asshole for like looking at someone else but you are for verbally abusing your girlfriend because she was a little upset that you looked at other women and felt insecure.   
I always try to say ""you're not to your answer but yes you are to other things"" but it's just sound like they use this space to vent and to search for external validation rather than to have actual opinions on it. I'm new to this sub but this is something that I already noticed. What I mean is that you complain about the answer being strange or a bit biased but you seem to forget that the answers are mostly that way because of how the op presented things. If op is basically making a case for him to try to get validation from people, people are gonna put themselves in their shoes and judge on intent instead of actions. And this is where it gets fucked up. Because if you judge on intent almost nobody is an asshole. They always have reason to act certain way. Except if they're really fucking petty. You'll see their POV and you'll get it. 

But it's not about getting where they come from it's about saying whether or not it's a morally bad move. 

I mean that's my opinion of it from what I've seen. I don't know if it's worth much because I might be a part of the problem too. I am very guilty of giving advices I don't come here particularly for that but I always make detailed answer (especially when op is an asshole to me) where I point out what I had issues with and why, it's hard to not add what they could have done better instead.

You also have a great point that a lot of times people focus on the details of a situation to the point of losing sight of the actual issue.

It is extremely easy to judge. Whatever you read here is only ONE person’s side of the story, you will never, ever know the full truth. and that’s why I personally feel like most of these judgements (is that how you call it?) are... one-sided (?) I guess? If you know what I mean.

NTA being equated with Justified Assholery.

On this idea, anything can be justified. Anything. If someone quite obviously harasses and provokes me, especially along lines that violate ideals that large swaths of Reddit's community loathe, the concensus often aligns to justify my retaliation, within limits. This obviously isn't universal and there are certainly areas where an individual erects boundaries and enforces them that get presented as Assholery followed by an OP coming to this community for an outside perspective. Most recently where I've observed the particular problem I see: there was a teenager that reached a limit and flipped out. Top comments all flew the NTA flag with perspective that justified the reaction. I chewed on this on and off for the past day.

Some people really really need to hear that.

But. It has also taken over much of the internet to the point where even mild dissent is dogpiled. People suggest cutting off friends and families as a first resort, or in situations where that doesn't really work. It's not acknowledged that in many parts of the world it's very different. There's a lot of focus on ""but I shouldn't \*have to\*"" with little exploration of the consequences. Phrases like ""don't JADE"" and ""lack of planning on your part doesn't constitute an emergency on mine"" are deployed in situations where they really aren't needed. And I say this as a childfree person who has pretty strong boundaries too.

In addition to people just having that viewpoint, which is fine, they also tend to jump all over and make tons of assumptions about people who do otherwise, which is really frustrating.

If you’re judged NTA, it’s saying of the people in the situation, someone else is the asshole. Too often to I see an obvious NAH post like “I said something mean then apologized, then he forgave me, AITA?” where it’s clear no one is in the wrong. This wouldn’t be NTA because it implies while you aren’t the asshole, an asshole exists.

828,f0wutiz,t3_d6xoro,"I have an example!!! There was a post here awhile back by a woman saying that her and her husband got into bed to watch the season finale of Game of Thrones, which she was really excited about, and once they got there her husband had brought a bag of chips, in to their bed, and was eating them audibly. Being directly next to him in a room that was silent other than the TV and the crinkle of a chips bag and crunch of chips in his mouth, she asked if he could hold off eating the chips so she could focus on the show (she didn’t even mention being annoyed that he was eating chips while lying in bed, which would annoy me personally since there’s no way that chip crumbs weren’t getting in the sheets). 

He refused to do so, insisting that he continue eating said chips in their bed. At this point she said they should watch something other than GOT in that case, because she wanted to be able to focus on the episode, which he responded to by STORMING OUT OF THE ROOM.

Aaanndd Reddit deemed her the asshole and downvoted all of her comments.

Dealing with family (including partners/spouses) often involves A LOT compromising, and taking a good long look at whether you want to burn it all down for one point, even if you are ""right.""

Intenet values, as you so cogently put it, are all about digging in and being inflexible with the people you interact with because you are ""rigtht.""

I'd even go a step further and say sometimes being an asshole to someone is necessary.

Aside from downvoting, which is a shitty thing to do just for disagreeing, the problem is that you're looking at the aggregate rather than the individuals that comprise it.  It's really hard to avoid this too when you're on the receiving end because you feel like the people in the majority must be right.  In reality, group feedback can offer a poor lens through which to view the problems of individuals.

I'm all for being fair to dissenting takes and I've certainly seen those big threads that hit the front page, where the consensus is mostly one-sided and squeezes out other perspectives.

But to say you know what's normal, as if human beings and cultures are all exactly the same is misleading and naive. Furthermore, many situations are highly context-based, which is another reason why sweeping proclamations about what is or isn't normal behavior can be problematic. Many of the big blowup threads I see here (as I often only come from the front page) are situations where it can look like something totally different biased on the title, versus when you read the actual details.

Yes other people’s children are not your responsibility. Yes, abortion is a thing that exists. But Reddit translates this as:

A) I don’t need to lift a finger to help someone with a child who may need assistance.

B) A woman who gets pregnant but chooses not to have an abortion is entirely on her own and is not deserving of any help, support, assistance from anyone including the father. 

Sorry that’s not how a functioning society works. There are plenty of asshole parents out there, but if it’s someone asking if you’ll change seats on a plane so they can sit with their child and you flip your shit, YOU are the asshole.

A woman who doesn’t want to abort her child isn’t deserving only of scorn and half-assed libertarian lectures.

I mean there was a case recently of a kid who got pregnant and didn’t want to abort or give up her child. The mother of the pregnant teen came on and asked if she was the asshole because she was going to shift her into welfare housing and full time work because she wanted to enjoy her retirement and didn’t want to lift a finger to care for a grandchild.

Some interesting food for thought, as mostly a lurker on the AITA board I can defiantly see OP’s point. Though I do wonder if part of the point of the sub is have a look at the details, and encourage people to think what might be social assholery should be taken with grain of salt, or encourage readers to consider differently and thus have that be in mind the next time such a like event occurs; for instance this example used by the OP:

“*They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while.”* 

Something like that seems entirely dependent on the micro social culture engendered by the place in question. In the 4 almost 5 years I have been at my job, no one has ever mentioned or pursued anything like the staff getting together for drinks or anything even remotely semi social outside of work; and if anything, if someone were to come in and begin doing so in a more than passive suggestion, I dare say the feeling amongst the regular staff would be the inverse. The micro climate here is filled with mostly post -retirees who used to work in education in some way shape or form. The last thing they would be enthusiastic to pursue is a semi-casual social obligation to satisfy workplace niceties, I am sure 3 or 4 them would be of the mind that one of the pros of being retired is no longer have to do such things in order to play office politics or “not be that guy”; especially from a job that for ¾ of staff serves as their provider of “walking around money”.",t3_d6xoro

For some reason, a lot of comments (I won't say majority or minority) were saying that OP wasn't an asshole because of the idea that people like that will never change. One comment stated along the lines of, ""It would set a precedent that his friends would easily be able to take advantage of him whenever they wanted."", even though it seemed like this was a one-time incident. The idea that people legitimately might think that a one-time incident will undoubtedly lead to a downspiral in the relationship is one of the most absurd ways of thinking (extreme thinking).

Despite that, it's still honestly great to hear different takes on a situation/scenario, but it's jarring to see people massively downvote comments that have their own opinion and support when they might have a fair point. HOWEVER, I will say that some comments really do deserve the massive downvotes if they: A) Have no support for their rating (e.g. just giving a rating with no reason), or B) Go on a tangent or rant that really has nothing to do with the situation (e.g. Post is of a female dealing with a situation, and a commenter instead steers their opinion towards being misogynistic).

But it still works for what this sub is. People come here to be judged *by their peers.* Anyone posting questions to this sub already has some respect for the views of the sub, and possibly the site as a whole. How often do people anywhere open themselves up to judgment by people that have totally opposing views?

You don't even necessarily take the first or most upvoted piece of advice, also. There are plenty of arguments to sift through on just about any AITA post. And in my experience reading this sub, the top/best reply is often not analyzing the entire situation or taking anything in context and just jumps right on an answer of asshole/not the asshole. There are certain things that if you just take the title, yeah; you're an asshole. But then you read the post and see that maybe they were justified and not really the asshole, and still get the most upvoted reply calling them an asshole while missing a huge detail in the body of the post that, when pointed out, flips everyone's opinion because *most* of them didn't read a damn thing behind the title and the first reply they see summarizing the OP.",t3_d6xoro

There is no personal connection to any of the people involved, there is no social constraint requiring a false positive or negative.and you are exclusively getting the viewpoint of the OP.

If you refuse to be civil to your coworkers and are such a precious flower that you think it's socially acceptable to keep even the fact you live in a HOUSE and are married and to keep your so called friend/coworkers weirdly in the dark about the honestly boring no one gives a shit hum drum reality; you really shouldn't be working with people and if you do, at least accept the fact that they are entitled to think you are weird, rude and make their working day less pleasant. It seems like everyone on that thread decided that since there was ANOTHER asshole involved and that technically it's fine to keep your private life private and that in principle many of us agree with the principle of separating work and private life, then that meant the very assholish OP MUST be innocent of all bad intent.

For the record that's not ""the real world"" or ""most people"", across the board. It's a small sample geocentric, and egocentric generalization.

I think I get what you're trying to say, but in your post there's an enormous amount of ""my perspective and experiences"" are the real world...

However, you can go to two different sides of a single city and ""people in the real world"" can be extremely different with different norms.  Just between northern and southern neighborhoods-for example take Chicago (much less internationally.

Lastly, I'd mention that even though there may/may not be a correct view or answer here, you should be careful of just trying to preach lowest common denominator values. Yes you can couch them in an annecdotal ""don't be an asshole to kids"". But there are lots of things the general public is fine with that could be argued against legitimately.

I made the observation that nerds tend to have a very strong sense of fairness and following the rules. It's a very objective and non-emotional standard. In this situation, it doesn't matter how long you stood in line.  The rules are clear and fair and the room was at max capacity.

My wife disagreed. She felt that if you stand in line for hours, you should get some kind of pay off for it.  It's a standard of fairness that accounts for personal effort and emotions.

I think it's fair to say that the people who post and comment on Reddit tend to skew nerdy and you can see the non-emotional standard of fairness being applied here.

To use something that popped up on another site, someone was venting that it's a waste of time to say good morning at work. It interrupts his work, acknowledging that it's morning is pointless, and we're not here to socialise.

He's sort of, mildly, right. What was explained to him was people aren't acknowledging it's morning; they're acknowledging they wish a colleague well. Humans are social creatures; it's a morning ritual that takes 1 second to reaffirm you've got the back of the people you spend 8 hours a day with. So even if you struggle with this concept, it's worth indulging in, because a more harmonious and collaborative office is worth your 1 second greeting in the morning.

I feel like if that question was asked here, a lot of responses would be ""NTA, you don't have to talk to anyone if you don't want to. Focusing on your work and sorting your stuff is valid. They can get with the program."" 

Sometimes you can be right, but it's better to be kind. If someone took the above advice to heart, the likely outcome is they get labeled the office asshole.

AITA is a karma sink if you drop below the comment fold. Once you're below, generally you only get downvoted, and you get downvoted *hard* if you're below the fold *and* went against the consensus.

On the plus side the mods don't like the downvoting either, they're just not sure what to do about it.

Another interesting thing is that early in a thread's lifetime you'll see a mix of opinions. Over time, the opinions with a minority judgment are downvoted out of visibility (and sometimes into oblivion). After enough time has passed, it looks like there is unanimous praise or condemnation of the OP.

Reddit has a simplistic voting system that tends to function poorly here. Because every top-level post has a judgment on it, it attracts attention from people who will reflexively downvote any judgment that differs from their own, *regardless* of content. Once hidden, it tends to stay down.

To show that I'm not *completely* talking out of my ass here, here's an example:

https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d4x0zs/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_26f_that_i_55m_will/f0hq29m/?context=3

The parent post here was sitting at -20 when I posted a reply essentially saying: ""I disagree, but this post should not have been downvoted"". After I posted, drawing attention to it, it gradually got built back up to around 146.

What do you think happens to people who take the time to write a good reply and get downvoted to oblivion, who *don't* have a stranger browse at low scores and gamble karma on pointing it out? Do you think they will stick around? What sort of people remain?

If there was ever a sub that drove the need to be able to customize how downvotes work in a sub, it would be this one.",t3_d6xoro

1145,f0xazwa,t3_d6xoro,That's the problem with much of Reddit. A lot of people on Reddit are sheltered and lack actual real world experience.

1152,f0xbjqc,t3_d6xoro,"Reddit is cancer. I think everybody knows that.

You know, I can sort of agree with your point about groupthink, but I'd be careful about it going the other way. It seems to me that people are coerced to come to the same opinions IRL, and I think people are free to say how they genuinely feel online.

There's a sort of freedom to be authentic that cyberspace allows, and I don't want to dismantle that. There's more groupthink in real life than online.

Which is why we see these entirely clueless people that come to shocking realizations only when they stop to think critically for a moment. Case in point the guy that went to his ""friend's"" wedding as an usher. How did he find himself in that situation if not groupthink and social pressure from his ""friends""?

But you're more or less right in noticing the cancer of Reddit infecting the sub in quesiton, and turning it misanthropic. I'd just like to say to everyone: Be critical and use reason when evaluating. And sometimes it's necessary to be assertive in an assholeish way.

As for downvoting, that’s Reddit, which is why I rarely participate these days outside of subs I mod or subs for my anime series. If you don’t agree with the hivemind, you’ll be downvoted to fuck.

As for your one point about not babysitting for your brother and not going out with your workmates, idk a single person who would call you an asshole for either of those. Unless your workmates are paying for ALL your drinks and providing transportation I’ll be damned if I felt bad for not going. Not everyone likes to drink either. Now, in Japan where I live, that is a big issue, but I’m assuming you’re in the west.

It doesn't necessarily have to be what we would do in the same situation, or how we think the OP should act in his situation, we have an opinion and we post it, the end.  The OP has the responsibility of using that collective consensus wisely to apply to their own situations.  We don't and can't know all of the myriad of variables the OP is likely leaving out.

The second post was also about a couple, the gf was bisexual and wanted the boyfriend to go to a pride event. The boyfriend refused since he didn’t like how the men were dressed in that event. 

Now want to guess which one was the asshole and which one wasn’t?

According to reddit, not going to church once and be supportive to your gf is totally acceptable behavior, but the second someone doesn’t want to go to a pride event they are instantly the asshole.

I don’t have a problem with lgbtq+ people or religious people. But in either situation both couples took the wrong decision. Instead of working it out and trying to find a middle ground, they went to one extreme. 

If someone doesn’t want to go to a certain event that’s fine, if it’s your girlfriend that you really love then you’re going to do it at least once even if you don’t like it.

Maybe, just maybe, sometimes time people in the real world have different opinions from you and your friends.  
  
For example, while I agree with you about some of the examples you gave, like taking the last cookie or (attitude dependent) giving up your seat to the elderly, 
I disagree about going out for drinks with your coworkers once in awhile and driving 10 minutes out of your way to pick up a coworker whose car is in the shop for a week.  
Why? Because the first two are typical human social expectations of all demographics except assholes, the last two are not.  
Going out for drinks *at all* is not something everyone does, and hanging out off the clock with all of your coworkers is also not something everyone does, there are many demographics who don't find such things enjoyable and have no interest in doing them and so most people don't find those unwilling to participate to be assholes, just people who don't like those activities.  
As to driving the coworker to work, while most people would help out a friend being a coworker doesn't automatically make them friends and that sort of thing (going to someone else's home  and letting them into your vehicle with you) is not something you are required to do for just anybody. Simply working with someone doesn't make them your buddy and it's not anyone else's responsibility to make sure they have a way to work, it's theirs, which is why it is not being an asshole to decline.  
I have coworkers that have become friends over the years that I'd go far out of my way to help, and there's others that I work with every day that I barely know and would only trust on a limited basis and still others that I do know and wouldn't trust with even knowing that I lived 10 minutes away from them, let alone pick them up and take them home every day for a week. As there is no responsibilty to these people and such things are highly situationally dependent, a nta rating isn't a surpise.",t3_d6xoro

1396,f0y6rl6,t3_d6xoro,"The top comments of AITA are a gossip madhouse where any attempt at discussion quickly gets skewed by the crazies from every sub coming to try and affirm for themselves that they're the only sane ones around. The way reddit functions actively works against finding the nuance and compromise that are necessary to judge complex social situations, instead validating the most extreme positions and hot takes. 

It's easy to forget, but you're only ever seeing a small sliver of the total amount of comments on any given subject and the ones getting pushed to the top are the self-righteous of all stripes supporting each other, simplifying situations into black and white teams and trying to make their views seem more accepted than they truly are. You're not seeing 'normal' people comment, but the extremists out to convert others to their way of thinking. People who you normally wouldn't give the time of day, but who through manipulating the way the voting system rewards small, coordinated movements, make it appear as if they're worth taking seriously. 

That's something important to be aware of, because while you might notice when people you disagree with radicalise, know that the same is being done to you. There's many of these groups for whom AITA isn't a place to give advice but a place to indoctrinate people, made all the easier by having visible enemies in every thread to rail against. People only call it out when they disagree enough with it to see it as an opinion of a 'team' they don't want to be on and will agree with most popular opposite opinion to compensate. These tend to be the extreme opposite opinions that float to the top, which they otherwise not agree with, leading to a radicalisation in posting opinions over time. You could do an interesting study on the role reddit plays in the history of internet in relation to radicalisation.",t3_d6xoro

A big part of it is perspective. We’re only going to see one side of the story here, so whoever isn’t telling the story is probably going to be presented in negative terms. 

We also get background information as part of the format that we wouldn’t necessarily get in other circumstances. 

When someone asks if they are being an asshole for not giving a coworker a ride to work once in awhile, but adds in that person is a jerk to them all the time, it’s pretty obvious they aren’t being an asshole. Whether the poster is entirely truthful about that (as much with themselves as with us) is another question entirely. 

I’m relatively new here, but a lot of what I’ve seen is “probably legal, but maybe not the best move,” but maybe that’s just my selection bias at work.

This, absolutely. There is absolutely a huge dissonance between ~~normies~~ society and reddit.

Surely if someone feels the need to ask the question ""Am I The Asshole?"" (legitimately, not for karma-whoring purposes ofc) that's because they feel that society almost definitely sees them as The Asshole and want the opinions of people who can articulate them rather than silently judge from the sidelines. I mean, if people think you're an asshole when you also think _they_ are assholes, it's hard to take their opinion seriously, but if you find this subreddit and generally agree with the verdicts here and _those_ people think you're an asshole, you're more inclined to think ""huh, maybe I am"".",t3_d6xoro

Apparently this guy would get down on all fours and do this thing where he and the dog would go head to head and ""wrestle"" back and forth, every single night. And it was not lost on me that this was potentially a weird and disruptive thing to do and she was not being unreasonable in asking him to stop. Yet the judgement was near-unanimous that she was an asshole. Why? Because she had casually mentioned in the lead-up to this question that ""he loves this dog more than me,"" an incredibly common turn of phrase used to mean ""he loves this dog a lot."" And yet damn near every single Redditor in the comments used this throwaway sentence as justification for claiming she was jealous of the dog.

1447,f48bbvr,t3_d6xoro,"YES. I try to always offer an opinion and advice because I was an asshole teenager and young adult.

The problem I usually see is that people are just emotionally and socially immature. And I don't mean that in a derogatory way. Like, they haven't learned how to identify or cope with complex emotions. Or they're so used to family dynamics where adults exert power over children, that when they get to a living situation where everyone is equal, they fall back on old coping mechanisms that are more about power games than just talking. 

And the truth is, for younger people, I don't blame them. If everyone is going to be a jerk in a situation then what incentive do I have to eat shit and be the mature one in the group when it's unlikely that it'll be reciprocated?

Still, the advice I offer is drawing on everything I've learned as a 30-something about empathy, emotional intelligence, and conflict resolution, and they're the same strategies I would use with my colleagues, family, and husband.

Your point about the internet having different values could be more specific:  the internet *doesn't have shitty boomer values*.  I've had enough of pushy, meddlesome boomers that say everyone has to be the same and do the same things, and if you're not an extrovert, a child-lover, or a prude, you have to pretend to be one.  The internet's values are different than that because they are objectively better than that.

Don't recall any polling or census questions. Kindly point to even the most miniscule of facts to back that up.


Your epic whining tantrum actually undermines your entire complaint. Your values clearly are NOT the majority. You're pissy because Reddit won't think they way you have decreed correct.

We get enough butthurt complaining from the mods, if you don't like the way AITA thinks you could always start your own sub. I doubt anybody would use it because it's very clear that you're in no way aligned with an overwhelmingly large majority.


 It's just an asshole move to complain this sub doesn't represent the ""world"" because very few people agree or vote as you would have them. You make no sense. Very few people agree with you but you're the one who represents the values of the majority? Really?

If you think your farts smell of roses and lavender, ok. When the rest of the room is gagging and asking where the rotten egg smell is originating don't pretend the crowd of people dry heaving have it all wrong.

It's not AITA, it's you. Opinions are not a value system by the way and it's beyond absurd that you're looking to make some sort of values statement using this sub. It's truly rediculous to me that you'd complain that people's solicited opinions are the problem. It's the whole damn point.

One of if not the foundational value of western civilization, and it's an inconvenience. People on the internet way too often jump in to defend unvirtuous, unethical, or even degenerate behaviour.

People are biased in favour of an OP who presents their story in a certain way, people want to defend bad behaviour that they know they themselves would prefer exhibiting in such a situation even if their conscience knows better. 

Ah there is another thing, just actually listening to your conscience and letting it tell you what is and is not acceptable, it works 99% of the time, and everybody short of psychopaths have it there always, they just ignore it when convenient to their own detriment. Yes me too, I'm a person on reddit. 

The most common way this manifests itself in reddit posts is ridiculous rationalizations being used to justify behaviour that all parties involved deep down know is wrong, yet people will gladly pretend it's not if they can find a quick rational enough sounding loophole, and this view will then be upvoted to the top in a lot of cases.

It was all 'well why isn't he keeping out of others' way?' and 'he's allowed to blade down the stairs.'

Apparently on Reddit a person's freedom to perform a dangerous stunt is more important than the rights or safety of an (old) man who is minding his business, using a staircase he's probably used since before the punk was born. I don't know if it's an American thing or what but it was sickening. I asked how they'd feel if the guy got startled and missed a step and fell to his death, and the response was 'if he's so frail, what's he doing not hanging onto the handrail?'

Somehow, this sub thinks that because someone does something wrong to you first, it absolves you of being an asshole to them.  It doesn't, and depending on your reaction, you can often times come off as the bigger asshole.

But...this sub justifies and rationalizes it on so many occasions.  It has gotten to the point where I no longer read the comments because I don't have to.  I can with almost 100% accuracy predict the top responses, not just the NTA/NAH etc, but the reasoning behind it.

At that point, I believe they do need to take a good look at the issue and make an informed decision. If it wasn't important in the first place, it would have been brushed off.

That's just a matter of believing that men should have an equally valid ""out"" to accidental pregnancy just like women. The current state of human physiology and science puts us in a scenario where women have multiple options for avoiding raising a child if they accidentally get pregnant, where men are stuck with, ""If you didn't want to have a kid, you should have wrapped your shit up.""

It's a major imbalance that a lot of men are unhappy with. Without further scientific advances, the only real way to fix that imbalance is to develop some sort of ""legal abandonment"" clause for men who don't want to be parents.

It's more complicated than that. Sure, **some** people around here are like that, but often they hate the fact that servers have to rely on tips. We're not going to solve that by not tipping when appropriate, obviously. Whoever goes from ""servers should be paid living wages; making that the customer's responsibility is stupid"" to ""don't tip anyone ever"" is TA. At the same time, when a server is rude or incompetent, you'll see ""fuck them, they deserve it,"" and I can see why. Rewarding incompetence or rudeness goes against people's principles, and I can't completely disagree with that.

>This sub hates infidelity. If you ever suggest ""might have had a hall pass; the relationship may have been broken; consider what you can't see,"" you will be downvoted.

I mean ... does anyone not? If a relationship is broken, leaving that relationship is the best option (often complicated by circumstances, sure, but nobody's saying it's an easy way out; it's the right way out). Non-monogamy between consenting parties is another story entirely, but if you're entering a monogamous relationship and you end up not being monogamous, you're TA.

Is it understandable people don't find the right way to break up? Sure.  
Do people make mistakes? Yep. Does that make them TA indefinitely and irrevocably? No.  
But it does make them TA temporarily, in that specific instance. Nobody's saying there aren't extenuating circumstances. I'm not saying it's unforgivable. But it **is** asshole behaviour, and that's what the sub is about.

>There's very little engagement with posts that people disagree with - they just downvote, instead of replying.

This is where I agree - but that's a Reddit-wide thing, and a real-life thing. Polite (or, hell, impolite) discussion between disagreeing parties is, for some reason, not something that's happening a lot. It should be. You won't always be able to convince the person you're having a discussion with, but some degree of learning will occur if both parties are actually interested. Sometimes, dissenting opinions can strengthen your own beliefs because you suddenly realise what part of the other side's argument you disagree with the most. In any case, it'll show you a different perspective. That's not something to be afraid of, unless you tie your whole identity to the things you believe in - and that's something we're all guilty of to some degree, but we should maybe realise that's problematic and needs improvement.",t3_d6xoro

Like, I agree. I don't care about karma in a larger sense. But it can be frustrating and demoralizing to have people downvoting your opinions into the core of the earth and giving the people insulting you +100 for saying things that feel objectively ridiculous. It just feels pointless and like you're not getting through to anyone anyways no matter how much you try to explain and have a good discussion.

I remember a post from a while ago about a girl who wanted to wear heels to prom even though she was taller than her boyfriend, but he was insecure about his height and asked her not to wear them. I said something like NAH/mild YTA, because people can't help their insecurities, and it isn't reasonable to expect him to just get over this overnight. It's unfortunate that he feels that way and in a perfect world he wouldn't, but it would be hard to be the only guy in the prom photos who was being dwarfed by his girlfriend. Society constantly tells guys that height is incredibly important, and in high school it's hard to not be insecure about being short. In the scheme of things, I think it would be a little inconsiderate of you to prioritize wearing your first choice shoes over making a small concession to help your insecure boyfriend have a fun night.

I got so crazy massively down voted for that. I got all kinds of abuse for that. And so I pretty quickly gave up responding, because people were just being really nasty, talking anecdotally about how their boyfriend is short and secure so everyone should be able to do it, and generally not addressing what I actually said.

But my long comment was about how the internet just breeds toxicity and normalizes it. It starts because the lack of consequences and the anonymity so people get to be really mean. Others join in. And then more join in. And then more. And more. And more. 

Idk. It hurts my heart. I’m of the same idea, kindness is free. But what I really don’t understand is how people are okay with, or find enjoyment by intentionally hurting others. I don’t get the causality of deliberately being malicious towards others...

My job kept me up on the floors, so when this happened the kitchen would call me so that I could speak to the patient in person and resolve the issue. 

I can't even tell you how many times the kitchen would warn me about how furious the patient was and to ""watch out"" only for me to go in the room and have a reasonable, polite conversation with them.

I really pity anyone who is foolish enough to take legal advice from this sub because it's almost certainly wrong, or even if it's correct in some jurisdictions, a lot of people confidently make blanket statements like they apply everywhere when they really don't, so there's still a really good chance that the person reading it is in a jurisdiction where it would be bad advice.",t3_d6xoro

IIRC she ruled that the photographer would have to refund the entire amount because there is no finished product or even the possibility of a finished product. She also said that it would be the photographers responsibility to backup offsite since that's what standard practice is.

It's a sad situation, but this one is definitely NAH. Cant blame the photographer for the house burning down, but the people who sued aren't assholes for wanting their money back when there is no hope of getting the product they paid for.",t3_d6xoro

Not because his house burned down, of course, but because he didn't have a backup stored online even though that's very easy and inexpensive to do nowadays. Especially since 10% could easily be hundreds of dollars, it makes sense to not want to lose that money when you already aren't going to have your wedding photos.

One of the very first posts I read here (it was before the sub grew as huge as it is now, so maybe one or two years ago) was about a guy who had asked his friend for a ride to a resort town that the friend was going to anyway because the friend's girlfriend lived there. The friend said no and refused to explain why. Then the guy found out that the friend had suddenly agreed to give a ride to a girl he hardly knew. The guy's dilemma was ""AITA for being angry with my friend?"". Everybody declared OP a huge, gaping asshole because the friend ""didn't owe him anything"".

If friendships in real life actually were based on what you ""owed"" your friend and vice versa, they wouldn't last more than a week. There is indeed a such thing as common courtesy that goes way beyond what you ""owe"" people, and that courtesy could be telling your good friend why you can't give him a ride.",t3_d6xoro

2177,f0wlb6w,t1_f0w9xvf,"The one that really bothered me was the one where someone didn’t help locate a missing child even though they could. OP had left their child alone for a moment and came back to find the child missing. The cops were called and everything. The child was eventually found, and had just wandered of by themselves. But the AITA part was about the neighbour, who had seen the direction the lone child had gone off to but never told anyone, even when directly asked if they had seen the child. OP was angry at the neighbour and had gone off on them, ands asked AITA.

The consensus was YTA because no one but the parent is responsible for the child.

The only way that attitude made sense to me was if you had some other anti-child beliefs as well. Because if an adult due to their own mistakes were lost and someone knew how to find them and refused to tell the people looking, even when directly asked, they would of course be AH. It’s the only right thing to do. But because it is a child it’s somehow became a discussion about how you can’t be made responsible for someone elses child.

I understand if it was like, a 13 year old getting asked to take care of a little kid and they didn't want to. But it was a grown ass woman who ONLY had to make sure the kid didn't do something stupid for like 5 minutes. AFTER SHE AGREED. From the OP's side of the story she didn't even prod after the sister said no, and then the sister changed her mind and then let the kid do whatever the hell it wanted enough to bust his head open within 10 minutes? And yet somehow that was the mother's fault? 

Like christ, people should be held accountable for their words and actions. If you say you're going to do something, that you're absolutely capable of doing, you do it.

I disagree, but this seems to be down to the definition of asshole.

If their actions were justified, then they can't be the one who did the wrong thing, and therefore cannot be the asshole.",t3_d6xoro
2318,f0wzr9h,t1_f0wee61,"I disagree. I think analytically speaking, being justified in a certain action means you aren't the asshole for taking it. *That's all that justification means in a social context*--that society has agreed that the action you're taking is within the range of reasonable and acceptable responses under the circumstances. By contrast, being an asshole simply means that your actions do not align with the societal standards of decency or acceptable behavior under the circumstances 

So with that being said, it makes no sense to say that someone is justified in doing something (i.e. their actions are socially acceptable/reasonable) while maintaining that they are assholes for doing it (i.e. their actions are not socially acceptable/reasonable).

If you think someone is an asshole even while you consider them to be justified in doing something, I think you have to reassess how you're framing either the person's act or the relevant moral standards, because there's an inconsistency somewhere.",t3_d6xoro

For example. If I punch my neighbor in the face, I am an asshole. However, if my neighbor is threatening me and my family, and I punch him, I would never call that asshole behavior.

That’s not what the phrase refers to, obviously when it comes to literal consent it is your choice. The phrase became popularized in relation to abortion rights but the idea of bodily autonomy has become blown way out of proportion on this sub. No one is saying that “your body, your choice” isn’t true in some/many situations, but it gets thrown around as a defense to basically have carte blanche if anything involving someone’s body is involved.

The most frequent situation I see it used in is when one partner in a relationship wants a tattoo and the other doesn’t want them to get it. Yeah, it is your body and your choice, but that doesn’t mean your partner can’t dislike it or voice that dislike. Soooo many people here jump to claiming someone’s SO is abusive or controlling because they dare to even have an opinion on something that involves their partner’s body.

People in a relationship should be considerate of each other’s opinions, and that goes for the tattoo wanter as much.

>No reason not to demonize the right wing, considering they are literal human garbage.

Sorry, but I disagree. I know a number of people who consider themselves conservative, and a lot of them are truly compassionate people that I consider to be extremely misguided and out of touch with how the political system takes advantage of their supposed ""shared values"" to get them to elect politicians that perpetuate really harmful policies.

Obviously that's not all of them. Some of them are really just selfish and garbage people. And in that sub I agree that there is very often a really large amount that I would consider to be toxic to the point of being almost unreachable. 

But in general, I don't think just writing people off is a good idea. I don't think most people, conservative or liberal, see themselves as bad people. I think a really good example is the abortion debate. In my real life, I know a lot of people that are single issue voters on that issue. Not because they ""want to control women's bodies"", but because they genuinely believe that abortion is killing a child.

Now, I can't argue with them about that premise. I recognize that's sort of beyond the scope of what I can hope to convince people of. But I have had success and managed to change the minds of several people I know by helping them realize that even though planned parenthood does perform abortions, the other services they offer actually prevent an overwhelming number of unplanned pregnancies. Therefore, to reduce overall abortion numbers, it makes sense to support planned parenthood.

Obviously, it's a drop in the political bucket, but I've personally managed to sway the perspective of several people in my life with that argument. And it would never have been possible if I just assumed the least generous possible interpretation of their reasons for being anti-abortion and refusing to engage them.

>Theres no reason to argue in their echo chamber either. You'll either be banned, downvoted or ignored.

I dunno. I don't post there very often because it can be extremely demoralizing over time, but the times I have engaged I've usually been able to have productive discussion with a subset of the more reasonable members.

People are conflating so many things with being an asshole: Being technically wrong, being morally wrong, being selfish, being overly individualistic. None of these things make you an asshole, being an asshole is just being *mean*. And sometimes you gotta be mean, and sometimes you don't.  

If people keep asking you to go out of your way for them and it starts to become an expectation, at some point you need to be an asshole and say no.  

If someone is doing something technically correct and within their rights that is causing undue harm to another person, you'd be a HERO if you chose to step up and be the asshole.  

This isn't meant to dismiss the scenarios where you're right but being an asshole about it, it's a supplement. Being good or right and being a jerk have NOTHING to do with each other. They frequently are found in the same place, but they're distinctly separate things.

But reading the actual post, it seems like she just didn't realize that it was relevant information.

As someone who generally is not around young kids, I wouldn't know at what age it'd be appropriate for a kid to play outside on their own. Hell I usually misjudge the age of kids by a few years either way, I have no idea how big they are supposed to be. I might as well have seen him go across the street, not think much of it, truthfully say I had no idea where he was an hour later, and then when the parents found him across the street be like ""oh he wasn't supposed to go there?

Op also mentioned how neighbor “ lied to police saying she hadn’t seen kid and admitted it in front OP and police. I’m pretty sure if you lie and admit to lying to police about a missing person investigation the police will arrest you or something not just stand there and shrug. 
So while the comments about how no one is responsible for someone else’s kid is weird ( particularly in regards to telling the police that you saw a missing person) there is a lot of missing info.

Although these cases are really weird and naturally we're inclined to say they are the assholes, I'm not sure if I fully agree.

It depends on what we consider to be an ""asshole"". The way I see it, you don't have to do anything that isn't your responsability. I feel like if the person helped, they were a nice person. If they didn't, they weren't. But they weren't the asshole either.

Basically, doing nothing is not the same as doing something negative. I think that's where I draw the line.

When people say ""I'd say NTA but you shouted at them so YTA/ESH"", they really don't understand the nuances of a relationship causing a horrific or upsetting situation. A lot of the time, the asshole in the situation is about how people deal with the aftermath, not whether someone shouted or expressed their anger. In that situation, she locked him in the bathroom - I've been locked in a bedroom as a kid for time out and the only thing traumatic about it was that I wet myself and had to stay in pee-soaked clothes for half an hour, so I was actually glad he was in the bathroom.

Back in the day, Reddit did actually show the approximate number of upvotes **and** downvotes on every comment. It made things really interesting, since you could have a total score of +1, but also have a hundred downvotes canceling a hundred upvotes. I was so disappointed when they changed that system.  

Nowadays, you can only see if your comment is ""controversial"" (with the little red dagger symbol next to it), meaning you've received a decent number of up- and downvotes... but even then, I think you have to opt in via the settings.

For me personally, I'd almost always rather have the comment than the downvote because the downvote hurts worse. Even if I drastically disagree with someone giving me a negative comment, at least they've made an *attempt* to articulate why they think I'm wrong. I can respect *that* much, at least. But if all everybody does is downvote my comment, all I get is that not only am I overwhelmingly considered wrong, but that my opinion is so meaningless that they aren't even going to try to explain *why* I'm so wrong. A downvote, to me, is essentially equivalent to a meaningless insult post that attacks me rather than my argument, except it's worse because with an insult post, I can report someone for being needlessly insulting, or if they try to argue with me, I can argue back. But I cannot do anything about a downvote short of deleting my comment (which, me being me, I worked way too hard on), which is somewhat demoralizing when I get a lot of them on a single comment.

2725,f0wv00p,t1_f0wqlek,"I don’t think an hour is enough. Not nearly enough. I think it should stay in contest until judgment is rendered honestly. 

Only a certain subset read new under-hour posts, including many who, instead of posting how they really feel are creating a post that they think will be voted to the top comment to get another point. They decide this by perusing what the comments are already saying and not thinking through the whole situation very well oftentimes. This creates on popular new threads an echo chamber of people trying to quickly create the best top-vote worthy comment on flimsy reasoning. That creates a glut of one-sided shallow opinions. And not only that,  it once people take a stand on a judgment and post it, even if based on shallow reasoning, they tend to stick to their judgment later on and fight for why it’s correct, despite new reasonings and aspects and stuff brought up by others. 

Most people read the popular posts, where contest mode has ended for awhile. I have seen SO many threads where the initial (and top voted) comments are all one-sides, then later people who have nothing to lose because they know they’re too late to be top comment start pouring out the complexities of the situation and often the tide of opinion turns to a more complex (and in my opinion correct) opinion.... but it’s still drowned out by all the earlier shallow opinions and all the upvotes for them. I’ve seen it over and over and over again. I could name so many but one is the dad who didnt teach his older son who didn’t live with him his secret special skill, but taught his younger twins who did live with him and helped them start a very lucrative business. The older son wasn’t happy and all the initial responses and all the most upvoted comments said he wasn’t an asshole, that his older son was, and that he didn’t owe his older son anything so screw him. Later comments started pointing out the complexities of the situation and the things the father did that weren’t so great and once people started considering those things most agreed (judging by upvotes/downvotes later on) but it was too late. And I could name dozens of other thread examples like this. 

I’m not saying contest mode going longer is going to solve all this, but it’s one thing that would help. Honestly I’m just ranting in general.

For example, if a coworker played a childish prank on you (e.g. putting hot sauce in your coffee), and you decided to take revenge with another prank (e.g. feeding him oreos filled with toothpaste), you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who would consider you an asshole. Immature, maybe, but not an asshole, because you were *justified.*

She wanted some unreasonable things but was also rightfully pissed that her ex was treating the child he'd raised for six years like an absolute stranger, being cordial at best and ignoring when the kid called him daddy. So many people were calling the kid ""a symbol of betrayal"" that must make the ex physically ill whenever he sees him. Like, no, he's a *child* and while th ex didn't need to care for him monetarily it is beyond cruel to suddenly withhold affection from a child.

However, I think Reddit in general think too severely of the justice system. They think if a neighbor is annoying, you can easily get a restraining order. Or if your employee does something lightly wrong, it'll be easy to sue. 

Cops don't arrest parents or remove them from the house unless there is a *clear and present* danger. In fact, a cop *shouldn't* be arresting and removing a kid from their home for things like that. 

Don't get me wrong, I think locking your kid in a room or locking them outside (I used to have to wait outside in the snow for 10-20 mins) is a very bad way to raise your children. However, the fact is, foster care and being torn from your family is far more debilitating and painful than having punishing parents.

B) I enjoy how the confinement gets smaller and smaller. The OP couldn't check their cat and watch the kid at the same time. Plus probably felt a little at risk since the child just locked a living animal in a FREEZER. It was a bathroom, not a cage. To me that's appropriate punishment.",t3_d6xoro

We yell at cops for beating up suspects after the criminal runs, tries to beat up the cops, or mouths off - because we expect cops to be professional and manage their temper. It may be *understandable* that some guy who led you on a chase has pissed you off, but you can't beat them down because of that.

2890,f0xs1pc,t1_f0wweqy,">  One person I saw said if you put spicy stuff in your food you had better be prepared to eat it in front of the judge. With nothing to back him up but reddit itself.

I think because this actually *did* happen, kind've. I'll look for the citation, but I remember reading the story about a man whose lunch was stolen and the thief reported the guy for having food that was insanely spicy, likely as a booby trap. The thing is, the guy actually ate crazy spicy food regularly. He showed his lunch to the manager (*not judge*) and ate it without issue, so the matter was dropped.

But I think the point is that if you were accused of using ghost peppers as a booby trap, you'd better be able to actually eat ghost peppers and show that they are a normal part of your diet.

As for why someone would admit it? People are fucking nuts, man. There are people who call the cops because someone stole their illegal drugs! And Managers may not give a shit about food thieves, but will get pissed if someone puts laxatives in food and creates a potential criminal case at the company. 

Also, while you're totally right that a lot of stuff on LA is bullshit (the only real advice people should ever get there are Government agencies they can contact, ""people often threaten to sue but rarely do, get a lawyer if you actually do receive a summons"", and ""this sounds like an actual problem. Don't talk to anyone about this, especially law enforcement/other party and their lawyers and get an actual attorney""), much of the advice is for best practices. 

Will you be charged and convicted for booby trapping your food? Probably not. But you don't need to go to trial to fuck up your life, and it's a dumb fucking way to get back at a food thief. Ultimately, the true message of that advice is that the person is not as clever as they think they are, and that when people think they found a way to beat the system because ""how can they prove I don't eat ghost peppers stuffed with laxatives"", they're generally wrong.",t3_d6xoro

I’ve seen about a hundred or so comments from you in this thread all saying precisely the same thing: that social norms are bullshit and you’re therefore freed from criticism when you act out of selfishness and self-interest. 

Yes, most people will deem it as selfish to keep massive details of your life private from people you’ve regularly interacted with for almost a decade. I’d even consider it malicious and borderline antisocial behavior. There’s a fine line between enjoying some privacy and actively working to avoid any notion of having a fucking family for 9 years. Quite literally everyone I know would agree.

And that’s the thing, if *many people* think you’re an asshole, then that’s all that matters and all you’ll be associated with. Whether or not *you* think you’re an asshole is irrelevant. However bullshit you think ‘social norms’ are, they have a strong bearing on the way professional and personal relationships work, and if you exhibit behavior that makes others think you’re an asshole, then you’re going to be treated like one. Your relationships will deteriorate. Employers will start looking for reasons to demote you. *People don’t like assholes.*

I apologize for replying to a 3-day-old comment with an essay but your mindset sprinkled all over this thread is an extreme example of the one this post is thankfully calling out. Having your own “social norms” doesn’t free you from the consequences of firmly established ones that—whether you like it or not—are what many relationships rest on.

Ok I may not agree with the rest of the conversation but I have to jump in here.  Child abuse is *way* more prevalent than people want to believe.  For your statement to be true, you either have to know a tiny amount of people very well, know absolutely no one, or be completely clueless about the true faces behind the people that are in your life at various levels of knowledge - familial, friendship, societal, acquaintanceship.  Unless you know well the guy you see on a weekly basis to buy X product from and can verify *he wouldn’t* punch a kid in the face, you are full of shit.

Start thinking about the fact that everyone you meet is capable of having a horrifying second face behind closed doors.  The smoke to this fire is the behavior of those closest to them.  Do they act out?  Are they violent, addicts, criminals, sexually daring?  Kids who are self destructive with parents who seem perfect are often (not always) crying out to let someone know that yeah, you *do* know someone who would punch a kid in the face.

The analogous torts case from law school deals with someone whose shed is being broken into. Guy doesn't like that, so he booby traps the door so that when it's opened the opener will be shot. Trespasser breaks in again, gets shot, and wins his lawsuit against the shed owner. Because you can't just intend to cause harm to another person like that.

It's one thing if I just like spicy food and that's what I make and it never comes up that I intend to harm someone and then they take my food. But it changes the second my intent changes.

In my state here in the United States, it is illegal to boobytrap your own property with the intent to harm someone (or with reckless disregard to potential harm).  It sometimes happens when someone keeps trespassing on property or stealing  property. Owner gets mad and sets a boobytrap to harm the intruder the next time it happens. Owner goes to jail. Doesn't matter that it's his property. Doesn't matter that the person was trespassing. The owner acted with intent to injure someone and that's a crime. Same principle applies to boobytrapping food.

You shouldn’t get death threats that’s just wrong, but the way I feel is, next time there’s a vote the longer contest modes should be offered sand if one wins it wins, and if not okay too. 

I’m almost wondering if this might also need a rethink in verdict time too. I see a contest mode that lasts until the verdict is in as the best option for these problems, so to offset those who hate the 18 hour contest mode the verdicts could just happen sooner. Like 6, 9, or 12 hour verdicts accompanied with contest mode until verdict, then afterwards sorted by best/top but verdict already rendered. This lets varied opinions have more visibility and a, in my opinion, fairer verdict, while also then letting people get into longer discussions based on high voted comments (it seems popular posts get to the front page after six hours or so maybe and then stay for 18 hours to over a day). 

And I was there way back when for the great verdict time debate. In fact, I’m not positive but I may have been the first one to suggest 18 hours! Someone else or others may already have. But I definitely remember seeing 12 and 24 as debated options and suggesting 18 as an alternative when I hadn’t seen anyone mention it, which that post got a lot of upvotes and well here we are, heh. 

So it’s not like I don’t like 18 hour verdicts. But times change and the reason for the longer verdict was to give more time for a verdict to possibly change upon further discussion. The sub has grown so much since then though and the top comment hardly ever (maybe never) changes after a few, at the most say 6-9, hours anymore (and I’d say the large majority of the time doesn’t change after the first two or three hours once the top post is set). Back then they did. Now there are just too many eyeballs viewing and voting for whatever the top comments already are as the post gets popular and reaches the front page. Then it’s too late for any change. 

So personally I think it’d benefit the sub on its current state to shorten verdict time now to 6-12 hours, set contest mode until the verdict is in, and then after that the threads are just regular discussion threads like any other sub.",t3_d6xoro

3186,f0wft3s,t1_f0we85w,"No, that's just... no. This isn't a ""fries touching your veggies"" sort of deal or anything here. It's common sense that a majority of people would not feel comfortable to eat out of something that was used to clean a menstrual pad.",t3_d6xoro
3187,f0wvgww,t1_f0wt4eh,"Obviously I'm not saying share every detail. I'm saying that if just not giving info rises it to the level of lying by omission, then that phrase is meaningless. How can you do anything called lying if nothing is false? Where is the lying part of any of it? It's just omission

And just because you want it to be lying by omission doesn't mean I'm moving the goalposts by saying that it isn't lying by omission. I said I don't think she's the asshole, you said it's lying by omission. I disagreed. That's not moving the goal post. I provided a certain standard of what lying by omission needs (a falsehood), and you've been saying it doesn't need that. And it's ok to disagree, but we've just been debating whether it needs a falsehood. I haven't changed my standard on what a lie by omission is. And moving the goalpost would mean I changed my standard. Since my first post, I've said it requires a falsehood. Maybe not directly, but my situation in the first post was someone not correcting a falsehood.

I just think you like buzzwords.",t3_d6xoro

OP clearly does not want to form that kind of relationship with her co-workers, therefore she doesn't have to share anything with them. You sound like you'd be an annoying co-worker to have if you give this much of a shit about whether someone tells you they have a *dog.*",t3_d6xoro

There's looking out for yourself, and then there's keeping others happy. By all means eat that cookie. But I would feel much happier taking one instead of two if it means that I can make someone else happy too. That's makes me EVEN happier.

Plus stop baiting. I never said anyone was any age or race, and especially not a teenager.",t3_d6xoro
