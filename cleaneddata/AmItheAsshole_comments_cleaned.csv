13,13,f0whzc1,t3_d6xoro,"Two thoughts:

This subs really likes what I'm calling ""contract fetishism"". If there's an agreement, it needs to be adhered to no matter what, even if the situation changes, and even if the agreement was made in reasonable ignorance. Normal, well meaning people don't think like that in interpersonal situations. Contract fetishism is what you do to your HOA when they pass bullshit by-laws, it's not what you pull on your friend who asked to delay paying you back for movie tickets so they could afford a christmas gift for their child. 

The other thing is this sub is bizarrely hostile to feelings. People will get called an asshole for feeling a certain (often understandable way): perfectly normal fears, insecurities, and frustrations get the OP labelled as an asshole, \*even absent any actual asshole behaviour\*. Feeling insecure about your spouse spending a little extra time with someone else gets the OP called an asshole, controlling, an abuser, etc, even when they've literally done nothing and just feel bad about it. 

Whenever someone makes a post entirely about how they feel, my thought is usually ""Why are you here, you haven't done anything yet. Talk to the people involved about your feelings if appropriate; seek help from friends and family if not.""

21,21,f0x11m9,t3_d6xoro,"I see the situation as the following:

* Massive **polarization** of the sub: everyone's siding with one team or another, by downvoting anyone not siding with their take on an issue.
* the sub thinking they're the **social-rules equivalent of** r/legaladvice, pretending to **judge every situation on technical aspects**, missing the global picture. Someone can be *right* and an asshole at the same time.
* the way people are phrasing their post, they are **looking for confirmation and validation**, **NOT arbitration** between two plausible outcomes (YTA/NTA). They are not describing the situation in a way that would allow both YTA/NTA to exist, which would allow everyone to make their own judgement.

Instead we're seeing people framing the situation and immediately pleading their case in the same post, leaving users to decide which values/ideals they prefer to shoehorn this into the conversation and push for it, instead of weighting in the set of facts provided by the OP to determine if they are the asshole or not.

Example:

* OP post: ""a friend came to my house and brought along one of their friend. I planned to have pizza and beer, but the friend-of-friend is vegetarian and complained that I hadn't made something for them, even if I did not know they were coming. I then refused to cook a new meal or drive out to get something for them: if they wanted a special meal, they should have asked beforehand or brought their own. My friend is now upset with me and say I wasn't nice with their friend.""
* Actual situation: friend of friend came along, saw that there were only meat-based pizzas, politely asked if there was something else in the fridge or pantry, so that they could make their own meal or just eat a small leftover with them. OP got mad the new person ""ruined"" their pizza party, saw that as an outrage, when it could have just been a ""oh sure, there's some \[...\] in the fridge, or you could get some \[...\] from this cupboard, would it be ok for you?""
* Users end up spamming ""NTA, Your home, Your rules"", ""Who brings a stranger along without warning? ew how rude"", ""Being vegetarian is their choice, not yours!"", **not actually arbitrating the situation** \- *how much one should accommodate for unexpected guests* \- and instead validating OP for being... A grumpy host, potentially a mild asshole.

It's been a while since I saw a good AITA post, where OP was *genuinely* conflicted between two possible interpretations of a situation.

30,30,f0w668a,t3_d6xoro,"This is a really important point, and I'm glad someone's making it. A good example from the last 24 hours would be [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d6w9vq/wibta_if_i_told_my_inlaws_to_plan_and_pay_for_my/), where OP and his fiancee don't want a wedding reception, but his in-laws do, so he's wondering if he'd be TA if he ""told them that if they wanted the wedding reception so badly they should just plan and pay for it themselves.""

There's no disputing the fact that they don't have to have a reception if they don't want one, and OP's in-laws should stop pressuring them, which is what the vast majority of commenters are saying. But handling the situation the way OP proposes would, in the real world, result in unnecessary pain and anguish for two people OP should be forging an amicable bond with. He'd absolutely be sabotaging the future happiness of all concerned, including himself, if he spoke to his future in-laws this way before he's even married their daughter.

I'm not having a go at OP - he [responded to my suggestion in a really mature way.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d6w9vq/wibta_if_i_told_my_inlaws_to_plan_and_pay_for_my/f0vykz3/) But I wish commenters would think things through before advising people to dump their spouses or cut off their parents. Just because you technically have a *right* to do something doesn't mean it's a *good* thing to do. And in the real world - in relationships with family, friends, significant others, or the community at large - we do have to make decisions that preserve and build positive relationships, rather than getting what we think we deserve and leaving those relationships in ruins.

58,58,f0wj098,t3_d6xoro,"I think the issue is the distinction between ethics and etiquette. There are plenty of things that aren't ethically wrong (not holding the door for someone, or taking the last cookie), but still go against common etiquette.

The discussions on this thread tend to lean heavily toward what is, or isn't, ethical. And I think that's fine. First, because the sub's description explicitly calls it ""a catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us"" (indicating a preference for ethics). Second, because matters of etiquette don't really elicit discussion in the same way ethics do. Etiquette is a set of rules that exists primarily to streamline our daily interactions. The rules are (mostly) arbitrary, frequently antiquated, and vary drastically based on region, upbringing, and age. Ethics, on the other hand is typically based on moral principles and rational argument. It is much more interesting to have a discussion about correct moral principles, or what line of reasoning connects a particular action to a particular moral principle than it is to have a discussion about what Emily Post says about holding doors.

In real life, ethics and etiquette come into conflict pretty frequently. Etiquette says; ""stand up for that old person,"" or ""let that kid have the last cookie,"" while ethics says ""your sore back isn't less important than that elderly man's sore hip, and if he needs the seat, he can ask,"" and ""You're not responsible for the happiness of random strangers' kids.""

As these examples show, ethics can sometimes come off as cold or aloof because it doesn't put the same emphasis on being nice or appearing compassionate as etiquette does. But ultimately, most of us want to be moral people and well liked. But if I have to choose between being a moral person, and being liked, I'll choose being moral 100% of the time.",t3_d6xoro,i think the issue is the distinction between ethic and etiquette\there are plenty of thing that aren t ethically wrong not holding the door for someone or taking the last cookie but still go against common etiquette\the discussion on this thread tend to lean heavily toward what is or isn t ethical\and i think that s fine\first because the sub s description explicitly call it a catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of u indicating a preference for ethic\second because matter of etiquette don t really elicit discussion in the same way ethic do\etiquette is a set of rule that exists primarily to streamline our daily interaction\the rule are mostly arbitrary frequently antiquated and vary drastically based on region upbringing and age\ethic on the other hand is typically based on moral principle and rational argument\it is much more interesting to have a discussion about correct moral principle or what line of reasoning connects a particular action to a particular moral principle than it is to have a discussion about what emily post say about holding door\in real life ethic and etiquette come into conflict pretty frequently\etiquette say stand up for that old person or let that kid have the last cookie while ethic say your sore back isn t le important than that elderly man s sore hip and if he need the seat he can ask and you re not responsible for the happiness of random stranger kid\a these example show ethic can sometimes come off a cold or aloof because it doesn t put the same emphasis on being nice or appearing compassionate a etiquette doe\but ultimately most of u want to be moral people and well liked\but if i have to choose between being a moral person and being liked i ll choose being moral 100 of the time

Spurred on by the Internet, a lot of people previously silenced are finding their voices and finding that other people are like them, have the same experiences, and can talk to them. Women who submitted to abusive men can now read about signs of abuse and can find resources more easily than ever before. They may never have even heard that it's OK to leave, or know how to do it. Certainly nothing their extended family said--they told her ""just be a good wife,"" or ""God made the man the head of the household,"" or ""well, what did you do to make him mad?"" Sadly, abusers have a lot of willing enablers in many families, ""for the sake of family peace.""

Transgender issues are now being openly discussed. When I was a teen in the 1980s, NO ONE even talked about being GAY, much less trans. One of my high school friends has come out as gay DECADES after that time--it's nothing she could have said at the time. This kind of thing is true for \*many\* older Gen-Xers, much less Boomers. Think about the rigid gender roles of the 1950s. Many older people you know had to deal with that. Women couldn't even get checking accounts until the 1970s!  

So to sum up, sometimes the individualistic replies you see here represent people previously silenced who can now say something. Like the childfree unenthusiastic about babysitting. Reasonable people can disagree about whether they should be thought of as assholes or not to spend time taking care of other people's children, but it was a given that they would cheerfully do so in days gone by. Not any more--""childfree"" is a lexicalized status now, even, in contrast to the ""barren"" or ""unhappy bachelor"" of years gone by. New concept, new voices.

Or ""it's her body"" replies that seem to simplify an issue. There's so much baggage behind this one, and so much pain, that I can forgive someone reflexively defaulting to ""it's her body"" when it's a tattoo someone's partner dislikes. Assholish? Debatable--the point is that she didn't even have choices about her own body for much of American history. If the response is a little strident this time, it's understandable, to me at least.

73,73,f0whk2w,t3_d6xoro,"What ""value system"" aligns with the rest of the world? 

All value systems are subjective. All of your examples are your subjective view on what is or is not an asshole behaviour. Not everyone is going to agree with your views. 

You're essentially banging a drum with your post and saying there's an issue with people being allowed to express their views on what is or is not asshole behaviour that goes against some sort of world/universal standard, as if there is a universal standard we all agree on, when there isn't one, and people giving their subjective views reflecting their value systems should not be seen as an issue, in my opinion. 

For instance:

> People who don‚Äôt seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes. 

The complete opposite can also be true: people who value individualism and don't put stock in collectivism may consider the collectivists to be assholes.

Or in the case of your examples: there are circumstances in those scenarios where people would not be an asshole for doing what you describe as asshole behaviour - circumstances, and nuance, matter.

However, you do raise a point with respect to the hive mind trends we can see in posts and responses, and I've seen it go both ways (some threads there is say a collectivist response that is highly voted and the opposing individualistic take is downvoted, or vice versa).

I think that is more concerning than the fact that there are such diverse perspectives on what is or isn't asshole behaviour - as when the hive mind occurs it can stifle people from commenting and adding to a diverse discussion. Perhaps the period in which comments are randomized is not long enough? 

Or perhaps, on accepting judgment, we realize that while we can accept them all, not all judgments ought to be weighted the same: if someone gives a judgment but offers zero reasoning or is unwilling to back it up, well, I wouldn't put much weight on their judgement. 

But how we weight judgments and the ones we choose to give power to are individual choices that the poster will make. This kind of bucks the ""X judgment is popular therefore X judgment is correct"" - as if the popularity of a judgment makes it more correct than others (that's fallacious and illogical, but since it is often assumed it creates the kind of hive mind trend we see and bitch about).",t3_d6xoro,what value system aligns with the rest of the world\all value system are subjective\all of your example are your subjective view on what is or is not an asshole behaviour\not everyone is going to agree with your view\you re essentially banging a drum with your post and saying there s an issue with people being allowed to express their view on what is or is not asshole behaviour that go against some sort of world universal standard a if there is a universal standard we all agree on when there isn t one and people giving their subjective view reflecting their value system should not be seen a an issue in my opinion\for instance people who don t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism\the people around them are going to consider them to be asshole\the complete opposite can also be true people who value individualism and don t put stock in collectivism may consider the collectivist to be asshole\or in the case of your example there are circumstance in those scenario where people would not be an asshole for doing what you describe a asshole behaviour circumstance and nuance matter\however you do raise a point with respect to the hive mind trend we can see in post and response and i ve seen it go both way some thread there is say a collectivist response that is highly voted and the opposing individualistic take is downvoted or vice versa\i think that is more concerning than the fact that there are such diverse perspective on what is or isn t asshole behaviour a when the hive mind occurs it can stifle people from commenting and adding to a diverse discussion\perhaps the period in which comment are randomized is not long enough\or perhaps on accepting judgment we realize that while we can accept them all not all judgment ought to be weighted the same if someone give a judgment but offer zero reasoning or is unwilling to back it up well i wouldn t put much weight on their judgement\but how we weight judgment and the one we choose to give power to are individual choice that the poster will make\this kind of buck the x judgment is popular therefore x judgment is correct a if the popularity of a judgment make it more correct than others that s fallacious and illogical but since it is often assumed it creates the kind of hive mind trend we see and bitch about

Not because you are a prude or because you want to sleep with the person, but there is a social expectation that people will cover up to a degree of decency around visitors or strangers. There are few people who would wander around in revealing underwear around their roommate's boyfriend. Some may even get the wrong idea (or perhaps even the right one).

90,90,f0wgjii,t3_d6xoro,"I've been lurking on this sub for a month and this is what I've observed.

You generally get two types of popular posts here: validation posts where the OP is clearly NTA by any measure of common decency and seek to just be confirmed by the crowd, or morally obtuse OPs who are clearly TA, but want to argue that they are right. Rare is it that someone is humble enough to be genuinely open to the crowd's judgment. Honestly, this should be expected given the nature of the sub. It's human nature to be defensive rather than humble, and since all we have usually is the word of the OP, we can expect the narratives to be tilted in OP's favor.

I think the reason why judgments are often not perhaps in line with how the rest of society might decide is due to two reasons. One is that most of the clear-cut cases involve abuse, manipulation, or gross inconsideration of either the OP (or, in the case where OP is TA, the victim)'s rights. The sub appears to be weighted toward a thorough, even extreme, individualism in which individual rights and choices are nearly absolute so long as it follows the law.\* This individualism is a good model to apply when obvious rights are being violated, and the kind of people who are genuinely hurt and wondering if they're TA are the type who have trouble asserting themselves appropriately. They need more individualism and boundary-setting.

Life, however, is often more complicated than those cases. There are many instances in a failing marriage, for instance, where both sides can take some blame. I've seen this happen in real life more than once, where one can make equally plausible cases for either partner being more of a jerk than the other. It's actually relatively rare for the ""right"" side to be perfectly obvious. But those posts usually don't get tons of upvotes, even though we have a label for it (ESH).

The second is related to Jonathan Haidt's moral foundations theory (which [the Vice article](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/3kxkd3/am-i-the-asshole-reddit) that examined the survey of the sub touched on). The majority of the sub is liberal in political and social orientation. According to Haidt, those with liberal views tend to emphasize ""fairness/reciprocity"" and ""harm/care"" as the two central poles of morality. This is very compatible with a focus on individual rights, and the most popular posts tend to center around clear violations of fairness and/or obvious harm. However, conservatives tend to not only take fairness and harm into account but also ""purity,"" ""ingroup-loyalty,"" and ""authority."" This sub frequently sides against views that privilege these three factors, particularly ingroup-loyalty, based on how swift people are to advise cutting the offenders off completely, even if they are family, spouse, or longtime friends. ""Purity"" is criticized as being oppressive, and ""authority"" is usually suspect unless it agrees with the posters' views.

(A really good example is the recent locked post by the absentee biological father who insisted on being the only one to walk his daughter down the aisle. His appeal was almost exclusively centered around purity and in-group loyalty, which the vast majority of posters‚Äîmyself included‚Äîfound deeply repulsive. However, in many conservative cultures, his argument makes perfect sense, and is in fact related to the foundation of their traditional sexual morality. His view was blatantly patriarchal in a way that's scandalous to most modern people, but there are many places in the world where that view is not only mainstream, but strictly enforced by society and religion. That certainly doesn't make it right, but it does explain why such views even exist and when encountered seem so foreign and offensive.)

In the outside world, where there is still a mix of liberals and conservatives (one often dominating regions over the other), you're going to have more people who take the other 3 moral foundations into account. Haidt believes that this is a large part of the polarization of the country, because the two orientations are often incompatible with one another. When moral consensus begins to fade, you will inevitably get conflict. Here, though, there's actually a pretty thorough moral consensus, centered around individual rights and freedoms. Hence the seeming uniformity of the sub.

One last comment. I grew up in a conservative church where it was constantly bemoaned that society had fallen to ""moral relativism"" when the Bible said that morality was absolute. I never thought that was an adequate explanation for life's complexities. Now, however, it seems that black and white morality is back in fashion. Judgments here and elsewhere are often unnuanced, absolute, and sweeping. Perhaps we need a little more ""relativism"" to balance the scales again.

^(\*Major exception: adultery, where there is an absolute and unequivocal condemnation in nearly all circumstances and little to no sympathy for the participants. It seems nearly no punishment short of death is unapproved for cheating here. This is a big change from my youth, when many people wanted to give Bill Clinton a pass for his adultery and subsequent attempts to cover it up. He would not get away with it now.)",t3_d6xoro,i ve been lurking on this sub for a month and this is what i ve observed\you generally get two type of popular post here validation post where the op is clearly nta by any measure of common decency and seek to just be confirmed by the crowd or morally obtuse ops who are clearly ta but want to argue that they are right\rare is it that someone is humble enough to be genuinely open to the crowd s judgment\honestly this should be expected given the nature of the sub\it s human nature to be defensive rather than humble and since all we have usually is the word of the op we can expect the narrative to be tilted in op s favor\i think the reason why judgment are often not perhaps in line with how the rest of society might decide is due to two reason\one is that most of the clear cut case involve abuse manipulation or gross inconsideration of either the op or in the case where op is ta the victim s right\the sub appears to be weighted toward a thorough even extreme individualism in which individual right and choice are nearly absolute so long a it follows the law this individualism is a good model to apply when obvious right are being violated and the kind of people who are genuinely hurt and wondering if they re ta are the type who have trouble asserting themselves appropriately\they need more individualism and boundary setting\life however is often more complicated than those case\there are many instance in a failing marriage for instance where both side can take some blame\i ve seen this happen in real life more than once where one can make equally plausible case for either partner being more of a jerk than the other\it s actually relatively rare for the right side to be perfectly obvious\but those post usually don t get ton of upvotes even though we have a label for it esh\the second is related to jonathan haidt s moral foundation theory which the vice article http www vice com en_uk article 3kxkd3 am i the asshole reddit that examined the survey of the sub touched on\the majority of the sub is liberal in political and social orientation\according to haidt those with liberal view tend to

\-Not responding to any questions or INFO requests.

\-Responding in a way that's less ""nice"" than the original post.

\-Inconsistent details or actions, they say one thing but then do another.

\-Badmouthing friends or family. Seriously, does it not strike you as odd that, instead of talking a thing out with their alleged best friend, they chose to come here and talk shit instead?

\-Constant use of ""I I I I"" or ""my my my my"" or ""me me me me.""

122,122,f0wcox3,t3_d6xoro,"I logged into Reddit at work just to say that I agree and yet I don't either.

I do agree on some level that a lot of the sentiments are sometimes painted as VERY one sided but there are also some posts that try overly hard to give a lot of context, which can be helpful. 

But really, I disagree because while ""yes, it doesn't cost much to extend common courtesy to others,"" people also tend to still think you're an asshole for not completely giving into when sometimes people just don't want to and this sub can also turn very hard on those people as well. \[It's not AS frequent but ignoring that it does happen is a bit of an oversight.\] You can consider someone's side but still want to go your own way and people can judge that just as harshly because when you consider it should somehow make you overly empathetic when people have things going on in their own lives sometimes that isn't stated \[which we all agree with, when we note how ""one-sided"" posts can be. Not everyone wants to lay out all of what they're dealing when they choose to say ""no"" to someone.\]

At what point is not wanting to constant being infringed upon okay? \[Like the thread about OP's roommate that had a food problem and people where SO angry at the OP for not wanting to indefinitely change their lifestyle for someone because no where in the post did the OP note how long this other person would have needed to change their behaviour in their own home.\] This subs loves to talk about ""boundaries"" but rarely in the instances when people just don't want to have to always put out for someone else. Rarely are these people always so hard to be an asshole and be like ""not today fam"" but this sub also tends to lean to ""helping your fellow man at the expense of a little of yourself"" and can't we all have moments when we decide we just don't want to? Maybe they did yesterday (helped someone) and just aren't feeling it the day they get called out by someone they know as an asshole. But that's the issue with this sub.

There's a lot wrong with this post, but I think the highlight is ""more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub‚Äôs judgement of who‚Äôs the asshole in a given situation"". This is true, but irrelevant. People in the real world suck - they brainwash their children selfish beliefs, they're abusive, they give special treatment to attractive people, they're selfish, they're rude to people in the service industry, they litter - we know this, which is why we come here to get a broader more enlightened perspective.

I was on board at the start - because it's true this place, like any particular 'place' will be an echo chamber to some degree, and it's good to remember that - but the post ends up coming off like a claim that the the perspectives here are somehow not applicable to the real world. Well, they might not be perfect, but if the goal is as close to objective moral/ethical perfection as possible and the true answer is ""3"", I would say Reddit's ""2"" is better advice and worth following even if the real world around you is pushing for ""0"".

No, I'm not an asshole for not going out for drinks with my co-workers once in a while. The ""real world"" might disagree because it's selfish, but that's farther from the objective moral/ethical truth than ""no I'm not"".

127,127,f0x2f3t,t3_d6xoro,"For me it's the ""YTA"" comments for pure ideals that bother me the most. 

 Take the poster who had racist parents although he wasn't racist himself. They didn't want their daughter to bring a POC (Jamal) to them, because it would cause a huge issue during the entire visit. 

 To me that's understandable. Especially when you don't see someone once every so often. 

 I could see it being a bigger issue if his daughter was married. The parent was just trying to keep the peace for parents he hasn't seen, and it's totally okay to do that.

 I've been in the same situation that Jamal is in while dating someone of different racial, cultural, religious, and financial backgrounds. (I'm mixed race.) 

 There were many times my GF at the time told me I couldn't go visit her since so or so was visiting, because it would cause drama. It wasn't a big deal, and I told her to just enjoy herself. 
 
 It took time, but 90% of them warmed up to me, but there is always going to be that 10% who will find any reason to hate you. 

 One time three cousins started ruining a dinner with 12 people. It was getting heated, and so I smiled, thanked both parents for the meal, and excused myself. 

 Why? Since the last thing I would want to do is cause drama or external problems with the person I am falling for. I wasn't married, and it's not my place to cause issues in someone else's home by being there. I wasn't family, but just some random guy. 

 The only thing I care about in any relationship is wether I make the persons life better or make them happy. That is it - I don't want to cause a rift between everyone. 

 Also since when it is it acceptable to bring someone home who will cause issues? Racism and prejudice suck, but you won't fix it within a week. It's better as the SO to just really understand these things, and focus on what's best for the person you love.

That probably plays a part, but please don't forget the difference in knowledge between people offline and people online. In a relationship (friends, romantic, family, what have you) where people talk about the issue at hand a lot, that might be a different story, but some of your public examples (bus, etc.) include lots of onlookers who are likely to have no knowledge about OP's inner workings at all.

152,152,f0x46yn,t3_d6xoro,"I‚Äôve had a lot of thoughts similar to this recently about this sub. 

The particularly annoying thing is when people think it‚Äôs ok to inconvenience the people around them for their own personal gain. I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts like this. One specific example I remember was one that reached hot where a tall person was on an airplane and the woman in front of him reclined her seat onto his legs. When he asked her to move, she declined, and when he eventually got fed up enough to tell one of the workers on the flight, the woman who declined her seat was forced to sit back up but she called the man an asshole. The part that gets me was that one of the most upvoted and popular comments on that post claimed that he knew he was tall and that it would be an issue so he should‚Äôve either found a different (such as 1st class) seat, dealt with it, or just not flown.

Like what the hell? This woman made another person very uncomfortable for a mid length flight just to make herself slightly more comfortable. How is that ok in any capacity? You are not allowed to infringe in another person for your own gain, like, ever! Unless it is a super minor inconvenience for someone and a major benefit for you (like cutting across the freeway a bit too quickly so you don‚Äôt miss your exit and someone else has to slightly slow down), that is not ok.

185,185,f0wasdw,t3_d6xoro,"Yeah I see you're point, and I feel like a lot of the time the problem kind of lies with the ""definition"" of asshole that we're using. Personally, I feel like there's usually 3 main ""categories"" to fall under - nice/courteous/generous, asshole/mean/rude, and then ""neutral."" And really category is the wrong word, its more of a spectrum. The neutral category definitely doesn't fall under nice/courteous, but it doesn't quite fall under asshole either. I see a lot of situations where where people asking for judgement could fairly easily handle the situation slightly better and would fall into clear ""nice""/definitely NOT asshole territory, but the way they handled it/are wanting to handle it is much further over in the ""neutral""/leaning towards asshole. Basically, I'm not willing to vote YTA just because someone isn't doing the ""nice"" thing. 

In my opinion, given that this sub is called ""Am I the asshole,"" its not fair to judge someone as the asshole if they aren't at least REALLY toeing the asshole line.

My eyebrows shot right up when you spoke of collectivism in a positive light. What?! Just taking for granted that nearly everyone thinks collectivism is good? That's a bit out of touch with reality, no?

Then I get to the end and find you describe the general culture in this sub as individualistic? I mean, are you trolling? Trying to be TA on purpose to make a point?

I agree that when an unpopular opinion gets berated and massively downvoted not many will want to state their disagreement, thus kind of defeating the point of the sub. This has happened to me a couple of times and I'll get DMs from people who secretly agree, but dont want to state their agreement in the thread because they dont want to get caught up in that shit storm.

I want to end by reiterating my agreement, however. The more this becomes an echo chamber the more the main point, as I understand it, of this sub fades away.

>They‚Äôll think you‚Äôre an asshole if you don‚Äôt stand up for an elderly person on a bus.

i wonder if part of this is being inherently biased towards the person posting because you have their full context and thought process.

like if i said ""AITA for refusing to give up my seat for elderly person?"", then describe that i'm autistic with balance issues, i will fall over if i don't have somewhere to sit, and that means that if i give up my seat i will have to get off and wait for another bus, then people would probably say i am not being an asshole even if i append that with ""and i don't want to have to get into a long explanation that people may not even believe every time i ride the bus."" 

however people offline see a relatively young person with no obvious injuries or health issues and comfortably say i'm the asshole.

combine this with a lot of times that people are percieved as an asshole not necessarily for *what* they did, but *how* they did it. we are getting an inherently biased account of how the other people did things, espicially if op had strong feelings in this situation that are clouding their memory. like maybe when someone asks me to give up my seat i'm already feeling nervous and defensive because i'm remembering all the times people didn't take my disabilities seriously until they had to fill out an accident report, so then i perceive them as being much more aggressive than they actually were. however my biased perspective is what makes it into the post, earning me a NTA (and the other person is).",t3_d6xoro,i m not a regular on this sub but occassionally it front page and i read a bunch of thread\they ll think you re an asshole if you don t stand up for an elderly person on a bus\i wonder if part of this is being inherently biased towards the person posting because you have their full context and thought process\like if i said aita for refusing to give up my seat for elderly person\then describe that i m autistic with balance issue i will fall over if i don t have somewhere to sit and that mean that if i give up my seat i will have to get off and wait for another bus then people would probably say i am not being an asshole even if i append that with and i don t want to have to get into a long explanation that people may not even believe every time i ride the bus\however people offline see a relatively young person with no obvious injury or health issue and comfortably say i m the asshole\combine this with a lot of time that people are percieved a an asshole not necessarily for what they did but how they did it\we are getting an inherently biased account of how the other people did thing espicially if op had strong feeling in this situation that are clouding their memory\like maybe when someone asks me to give up my seat i m already feeling nervous and defensive because i m remembering all the time people didn t take my disability seriously until they had to fill out an accident report so then i perceive them a being much more aggressive than they actually were\however my biased perspective is what make it into the post earning me a nta and the other person is

228,228,f0wkm72,t3_d6xoro,"I completely agree with you. It seems that a lot of times, the rubric for judging if someone is an asshole is ""are they obligated to do the thing everybody is demanding they do?"" If the answer is no then OP gets voted NTA. Meanwhile, in the real world, a person that only does what they're obligated to and lets other people struggle/suffer in the process  would be labeled selfish at best and an asshole at worst. 

You said it wonderfully. In the real world we live as a collective group. You help out your family and neighbors because it's what kind people do. Look, if you don't want to carpool with Bob because his breath stinks and you haven't told anyone you're pregnant, that's fine. Give yourself some slack, you're not an asshole. Even if you're not pregnant and you just don't like the idea of being alone with Bob. Again, that's your prerogative. But just understand that every day you have to face the people in the real world that might think it was selfish of you while the people that think you're 100% justified will never see you because they live thousands of miles away and judged you via the internet.

It'd be nice if answers were to elaborate on this. For example ""NTA, however, your SO's family might think you're selfish because to them you're abandoning them during christmas dinner. They don't understand you're taking part a 25 year family tradition with your brother at the movies.""

305,305,f0wxvhy,t3_d6xoro,"This will probably get lost in the shuffle (another issue with reddit as a platform), but I just wanted to say, this problem isn't exclusive to r/aita.

The following statement could be applied to all of Reddit:

>Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.


You can draw several conclusions from this. First of all, reddit is no longer a good place for discourse. There's just too many people on the platform, and the structure of said platform encourages popular opinions, bandwagoning, and extremism, simply because of the way upvotes work. As I said, the chance of my post being seen by a sizeable amount of people is just microscopic. It's been 4 hours, and there are already 2.8k comments.

The other, in my opinion, important conclusion is the way reddit as a platform impacts the real world. Reddit is massively influential, and it's been proven that the dialogue that occurs can be controlled by bots and an overarching agenda over and over again. When a post on r/aita reaches the front page, and said post doesn't align with reality, this post is now altering the reality and rationality of thousands of people. You said:

>out of step with how people in the real world judge situations

The terrifying thing is, for many people, they will now judge real world situations by these completely alien metrics. I'm talking, if it wasn't clear, about politics, but really, this extends far beyond that.

378,378,f0xen3y,t3_d6xoro,"Meh. AITA is never going to fully realize the purpose it was created for. You're asking for consensus on a topic that is inherently subjective (morals). Combine that with the fact that the OP has a motivation to skew the story they're telling to benefit themselves. In the end you get a subjective ""judgment"" on a 50-60% legitimately true post, which amounts to jack shit. 

Also we are all literally passing judgment on a term that isn't defined.  What constitutes ""asshole"" behavior varies wildly from person to person, except in extreme circumstances. Plus the potential judgments lack nuance. You have some posts that have tons of moving parts and points where OP is barely an asshole/not an asshole. Yet the limited voting options completely remove all of that and we are just left with asshole/not asshole.

So why pretend any of the judgments rendered here have any real merit? Just read for the shits and gigs and give your opinion when you feel like it. I think the fact that anyone takes the judgments from here seriously is comically asinine.

There was one on here maybe a month ago where a girl was like 18 years old had a two year old daughter ( obv was a teen pregnancy) and her older sister (like 26)  never wanted to help her with the kid and she doesn‚Äôt like kids and doesn‚Äôt want them herself. (There was some subtle hints that older sis was mad cus younger sis had baby young and the parents now have to help) Apparently younger sis leaves her kid with older sis cus mom (grandma) was at store and older sis very reluctantly agrees to watch her niece for the few minutes that their mom would be gone at store. And turns out baby has to be rushed to emergency like not even 10/20 min after leaving her kid with older sis 
 
Everyone on here was saying young mom was the asshole for blaming sis for the accident. Some moms even chimed in and said well they do get away from you fast and blah blah  (I understand accidents can happen but geez within minutes of her watching child?!) and that ‚Äú she did tell you she was uncomfortable watching kids‚Äù like wtf!! I do not want kids  I hate watching them myself but I‚Äôm sorry when I‚Äôve been put in similar situations I‚Äôll watch the hell out of those kids BECAUSE of scary incidents that can happen like this in an instant. 

Now maybe she wasn‚Äôt to blame directly (although I was getting some sociopathic vibes myself since she was never okay with her sister bringing her child around and hated the parents babysat but that‚Äôs a whole different discussion) but yes I‚Äôm sorry you are gonna get blamed in the  heat of the moment! It‚Äôs just natural and yeah that can be seen as asshole but how ppl were explaining the YTA was even worse because ‚Äúwell your sister did tell you she wasn‚Äôt comfortable watching kids‚Äù 

Like are we fuckin serious?? It‚Äôs your  niece!! And the mom (grandma) was going to come back within like 20 min tops wasn‚Äôt like she had to watch her the whole day! That one weirded me the fuck out cus we‚Äôre talking about a baby here and whether we want them or like them if any family member brings children around you idk why naturally as humans your guard shouldn‚Äôt  be up for them.  They‚Äôre just learning things and are figuring stuff out. To me it honestly sounded like the sister just let the little girl do what she wanted and was like ah idk what to do with these things whatever I‚Äôll just let her do what she wants since it seems like she knows what she‚Äôs doing

So many examples of people on here with the same sentiment of ""I'm not an asshole because I technically am not required to do / not do X"" ... just because there's no law against something, they've decided it's not asshole behavior.

SO WHAT? Hurting other people without an excellent reason makes you ... An asshole! Yes it does!  Whether you paid for the privilege or not! Wow!

I got downvoted to hell for saying the guy who took the blueberry pie instead of letting the little girl have it was an asshole.  ""He was in line first"" was the reasoning.  Really? Being in line means you're not a mean person?

That's cool. I think they're assholes for assuming I should have to sacrifice something that make my day suck a little less just because a kid wants it. I'm really confused about why people think being a child makes you more entitled to sweets than the adult who was in line first. People love to hate on us ""child-free"" folks who supposedly hate children. I don't hate the kids. I hate when parents think I owe their kids something JUST because they're kids. If that makes me the asshole, so be it. The simple fact is, there's always going to be a group of people who are going to think you're an asshole regardless of what action you take. So yeah, someone might say ""you're an asshole for purchasing the last cookie and now my kid is crying"", I'm going to think they're the asshole for not simply explaining to the kid that you don't always get what you want in life and instead treating a stranger like they owe you something when, in reality, you have no idea why the person was buying said cookie. Maybe they were buying it for THEIR kid. Who knows. The reality is, when you become a parent, you knowingly sign up to making sacrifices in terms of your personal happiness for that child. The rest of the world didn't.

Should I as a stranger go out of my way to stop a kid from doing something that would hurt them? Absolutely. I can reprimand you for not watching your child later, but keeping them from harm is important. I WOULD be the asshole for not helping in that situation.

But when one person describes their shitty behavior on this sub to a bunch of other individuals it's like we see ourselves in the OP and we side with them on an individual level. But you're so right.

567,567,f0wkj6o,t3_d6xoro,"Actually nobody is forcing people to vote with the most popular ones - the popular ones may truly represent the values of those who are prepared to engage in online forums. Personally I tend to agree with about 70% of most popular conclusions. Sometimes a viewpoint is popular and lots of people will support it and hate those who argue against - these are charged situations that people may well recognise in their own lives or in those of their family or friends.

Certainly this sub represents western values, those who raise queries concerning family obligation aspects don't go down well when the parents are AH to their children. I'm not saying that's wrong - I'd subscribe to that viewpoint myself - but it doesn't represent how the wider society they live in may  then view those children if the families are not in a western society but in another country which has a hierarchical obligated family ethos being valued.

In fact I think I'd disagree with this OP as sometimes being polite and considerate in a particular set-up is being a doormat or a polite considered reply to certain circumstances simply won't cut it and I don't think that not being ultra-polite or occasionally looking after your own interests first makes you an AH. Life is not being a super polite soul who always puts other people first otherwise you're definitely an AH. Context is SO important - the number of posts where I've read the title and it sounds like the OP must be TA but when you read about their problem in it's context then you think ""ah no, this is complicated and I don't blame them in these circumstances..."".  Some responses have a lot of people thinking ""justified AH"". 

A little consideration is one thing and that isn't always valued in the sub. 

The other thing I sometimes worry about is the speed with which people will *totally* cut others out of their life. I think that tactic started as a necessary evil to defend people against extremely toxic people - it wasn't called 'ghosting' or 'cutting out' but everyone as old as I am will know people who slowly lost touch with each other or had the experience of what is now called 'ghosting' but you just didn't talk about it then and it was expected. But talking about this tactic seems to have spread it possibly a little more than is warranted. If you're having a family dispute it doesn't mean you can't work through it.

One thing this sub is red hot on is cheating - nasty and wrong but this sub would treat cheaters like serial murderers, even on the first instance. But I think that's a reflection of wider society which has got very intolerant about this. It may be painful and impossible for a good number of couples to come back from. But some people manage to work through it and come out stronger but anyone doing that now is the object of scorn.",t3_d6xoro,actually nobody is forcing people to vote with the most popular one the popular one may truly represent the value of those who are prepared to engage in online forum\personally i tend to agree with about 70 of most popular conclusion\sometimes a viewpoint is popular and lot of people will support it and hate those who argue against these are charged situation that people may well recognise in their own life or in those of their family or friend\certainly this sub represents western value those who raise query concerning family obligation aspect don t go down well when the parent are ah to their child\i m not saying that s wrong i d subscribe to that viewpoint myself but it doesn t represent how the wider society they live in may then view those child if the family are not in a western society but in another country which ha a hierarchical obligated family ethos being valued\in fact i think i d disagree with this op a sometimes being polite and considerate in a particular set up is being a doormat or a polite considered reply to certain circumstance simply won t cut it and i don t think that not being ultra polite or occasionally looking after your own interest first make you an ah\life is not being a super polite soul who always put other people first otherwise you re definitely an ah\context is so important the number of post where i ve read the title and it sound like the op must be ta but when you read about their problem in it s context then you think ah no this is complicated and i don t blame them in these circumstance\some response have a lot of people thinking justified ah\a little consideration is one thing and that isn t always valued in the sub\the other thing i sometimes worry about is the speed with which people will totally cut others out of their life\i think that tactic started a a necessary evil to defend people against extremely toxic people it wasn t called ghosting or cutting out but everyone a old a i am will know people who slowly lost touch with each other or had the experience of what is now called ghosting but you just didn t talk about it then and it wa expected\but talking about this tactic seems to have spread it possibly a little more than is warranted\if you re having a family dispute it doesn t mean you can t work through it\one thing this sub is red hot on is cheating nasty and wrong but this sub would treat cheater like serial murderer even on the first instance\but i think that s a reflection of wider society which ha got very intolerant about this\it may be painful and impossible for a good number of couple to come back from\but some people manage to work through it and come out stronger but anyone doing that now is the object of scorn

Yes this sub isn't perfect, but honestly what advice subreddit is? 

I don't think it's up there at 50% wrong from what people in real life would say, I see a mix of answers with pros and cons and people generally do split hard decisions pretty evenly and make their cases. 

If anything this sub focuses too much on technicalities that let you avoid calling yourself an asshole when in reality you're being one. Also, sometimes, you are the asshole but people here tell you that you're not because even if you were being an asshole you had the right to do so which somehow negates the being an asshole. 

There is some confusion people have of whether being an asshole or Right to be an asshole is the different.

616,616,f0wmoc3,t3_d6xoro,"People's morals degrade the further they are removed from the consequences of their speech and actions.  
This idea is neither new or mine; things like [John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19) have been around for years.

While Gabe's theory focused on anonymity, I believe the problem is consequences. People say shit on social media, regardless of the fact that their real name is attached to their words, that they would never say to a person face-to-face. The difference is that they don't see the immediate reaction to their words on social media, and it is easier to characterize any online detractors as less-than-real people.

Giving advise to strangers on social media compounds the problem, as the adviser will not experience the consequences of their advice in any way (except for a possible UPDATE post).

A classic example I remember was when there was a table of college aged kids talking loudly and graphically about sucking dicks in a family restaurant, next to OPs table where they had their young kid and some of their kid's friends. She went over to the table and politely asked them to stop, and they did, it was all fine.

The amount of responses saying ""I shouldn't have to police how I talk just because you decided to bring your kids out"" and calling her the asshole for the interaction was unbelievable. I got loads of downvotes, as did others, for suggesting that maybe a family restaurant at lunchtime in the presence of children wasn't the best place to have that sort of drunken conversation, and that OP actually handled it quite well.

There should be a list of banned arguments/phrases like ""technically"", ""you have the right to"" and the idea that some wrongdoing on someone else's part means any reaction from the OP was completely justified.

662,662,f0wph1p,t3_d6xoro,"I think the sub is bound to not be objective first of all because most people have issue with self-awareness and trying to not relate or imagine themselves in a situation which will make their answers ultimately biased but also mostly because nobody can really judge if a person is being an asshole or not when the post is written by the person who lived the experience. It's really easy to influence how the results are gonna come up with the way you'll write your post, you're gonna put emphasis on certain things if you want people to tell you you were the asshole or not. It can be conscious but also unconscious. Basically if you think you were the asshole in the situation, you're gonna talk about it like you were and if you think you weren't you'll disclose a lot of information that'll justify your actions put not necessarily everything that's in favor of the opposite party.

It's not inherently wrong because some people (most people actually in my opinion) can probably see through the shit and some times point out that ""dude you were still an asshole"" but it riggs the answer. For example I've seen two different post about a guy getting into an argument with their gf/love interest and the question was ""AITA for doing that thing ?"" that was an obvious no when they completely lashed out at their girlfriend when they reacted slightly badly. Like no dude you're not an asshole for like looking at someone else but you are for verbally abusing your girlfriend because she was a little upset that you looked at other women and felt insecure.   
I always try to say ""you're not to your answer but yes you are to other things"" but it's just sound like they use this space to vent and to search for external validation rather than to have actual opinions on it. I'm new to this sub but this is something that I already noticed. What I mean is that you complain about the answer being strange or a bit biased but you seem to forget that the answers are mostly that way because of how the op presented things. If op is basically making a case for him to try to get validation from people, people are gonna put themselves in their shoes and judge on intent instead of actions. And this is where it gets fucked up. Because if you judge on intent almost nobody is an asshole. They always have reason to act certain way. Except if they're really fucking petty. You'll see their POV and you'll get it. 

But it's not about getting where they come from it's about saying whether or not it's a morally bad move. 

I mean that's my opinion of it from what I've seen. I don't know if it's worth much because I might be a part of the problem too. I am very guilty of giving advices I don't come here particularly for that but I always make detailed answer (especially when op is an asshole to me) where I point out what I had issues with and why, it's hard to not add what they could have done better instead. I know people come to this sub for it but it just seems so weird to call someone out on something and do absolutely nothing about it.",t3_d6xoro,i think the sub is bound to not be objective first of all because most people have issue with self awareness and trying to not relate or imagine themselves in a situation which will make their answer ultimately biased but also mostly because nobody can really judge if a person is being an asshole or not when the post is written by the person who lived the experience\it s really easy to influence how the result are gonna come up with the way you ll write your post you re gonna put emphasis on certain thing if you want people to tell you you were the asshole or not\it can be conscious but also unconscious\basically if you think you were the asshole in the situation you re gonna talk about it like you were and if you think you weren t you ll disclose a lot of information that ll justify your action put not necessarily everything that s in favor of the opposite party\it s not inherently wrong because some people most people actually in my opinion can probably see through the shit and some time point out that dude you were still an asshole but it riggs the answer\for example i ve seen two different post about a guy getting into an argument with their gf love interest and the question wa aita for doing that thing\that wa an obvious no when they completely lashed out at their girlfriend when they reacted slightly badly\like no dude you re not an asshole for like looking at someone else but you are for verbally abusing your girlfriend because she wa a little upset that you looked at other woman and felt insecure\i always try to say you re not to your answer but yes you are to other thing but it s just sound like they use this space to vent and to search for external validation rather than to have actual opinion on it\i m new to this sub but this is something that i already noticed\what i mean is that you complain about the answer being strange or a bit biased but you seem to forget that the answer are mostly that way because of how the op presented thing\if op is basically making a case for him to try to get validation from people people are gonna put themselves in their shoe and judge on intent instead of action\and this is where it get fucked up\because if you judge on intent almost nobody is an asshole\they always have reason to act certain way\except if they re really fucking petty\you ll see their pov and you ll get it\but it s not about getting where they come from it s about saying whether or not it s a morally bad move\i mean that s my opinion of it from what i ve seen\i don t know if it s worth much because i might be a part of the problem too\i am very guilty of giving advice i don t come here particularly for that but i always make detailed answer especially when op is an asshole to me where i point out what i had issue with and why it s hard to not add what they could have done better instead\i know people come to this sub for it but it just seems so weird to call someone out on something and do absolutely nothing about it

That way differing opinions would get posted more often - because people wouldn't worry about losing karma - and the top comments would still be on the top because people could still upvote the ones they like.

You also have a great point that a lot of times people focus on the details of a situation to the point of losing sight of the actual issue. I don't know if that's an indication of the internet or reddit's attitude, or maybe just because it's easier to defend your stance with things like 'legally you're in the clear', than 'you didn't break any laws but pretty sure everyone thinks you're a dick.'

NTA being equated with Justified Assholery.

On this idea, anything can be justified. Anything. If someone quite obviously harasses and provokes me, especially along lines that violate ideals that large swaths of Reddit's community loathe, the concensus often aligns to justify my retaliation, within limits. This obviously isn't universal and there are certainly areas where an individual erects boundaries and enforces them that get presented as Assholery followed by an OP coming to this community for an outside perspective. Most recently where I've observed the particular problem I see: there was a teenager that reached a limit and flipped out. Top comments all flew the NTA flag with perspective that justified the reaction. I chewed on this on and off for the past day. I have my own perspective on those things I have shaped to ""reasonable"" or NTA that invariably cost me in ways asshole behavior is apt to do. The majority of those same things I've seen others get NTA for. These two things stand in contradiction to each other. The conclusion I came to separates that which is justified from that which taints (dadjoke, couldn't resist) and labeled as Asshole behavior.

759,759,f0wssh3,t3_d6xoro,"This is an outgrowth of something I've been seeing on forums etc for years, I think. It's a particular viewpoint of, as you say, very individualistic values. There are some great things about that point of view. I have read and participated in forums and blogs that promote it and I think when it comes to things like ""hey, you don't have to put up with toxic people just because they're related to you"" or ""if someone treats you badly, they are NOT owed your friendship"" it can be absolutely fantastic. Some people really really need to hear that.

But. It has also taken over much of the internet to the point where even mild dissent is dogpiled. People suggest cutting off friends and families as a first resort, or in situations where that doesn't really work. It's not acknowledged that in many parts of the world it's very different. There's a lot of focus on ""but I shouldn't \*have to\*"" with little exploration of the consequences. Phrases like ""don't JADE"" and ""lack of planning on your part doesn't constitute an emergency on mine"" are deployed in situations where they really aren't needed. And I say this as a childfree person who has pretty strong boundaries too.

In addition to people just having that viewpoint, which is fine, they also tend to jump all over and make tons of assumptions about people who do otherwise, which is really frustrating.

I'm all for being fair to dissenting takes and I've certainly seen those big threads that hit the front page, where the consensus is mostly one-sided and squeezes out other perspectives.

But to say you know what's normal, as if human beings and cultures are all exactly the same is misleading and naive. Furthermore, many situations are highly context-based, which is another reason why sweeping proclamations about what is or isn't normal behavior can be problematic. Many of the big blowup threads I see here (as I often only come from the front page) are situations where it can look like something totally different biased on the title, versus when you read the actual details.

Some interesting food for thought, as mostly a lurker on the AITA board I can defiantly see OP‚Äôs point. Though I do wonder if part of the point of the sub is have a look at the details, and encourage people to think what might be social assholery should be taken with grain of salt, or encourage readers to consider differently and thus have that be in mind the next time such a like event occurs; for instance this example used by the OP:

‚Äú*They‚Äôll think you‚Äôre an asshole if you don‚Äôt go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while.‚Äù* 

Something like that seems entirely dependent on the micro social culture engendered by the place in question. In the 4 almost 5 years I have been at my job, no one has ever mentioned or pursued anything like the staff getting together for drinks or anything even remotely semi social outside of work; and if anything, if someone were to come in and begin doing so in a more than passive suggestion, I dare say the feeling amongst the regular staff would be the inverse. The micro climate here is filled with mostly post -retirees who used to work in education in some way shape or form. The last thing they would be enthusiastic to pursue is a semi-casual social obligation to satisfy workplace niceties, I am sure 3 or 4 them would be of the mind that one of the pros of being retired is no longer have to do such things in order to play office politics or ‚Äúnot be that guy‚Äù; especially from a job that for ¬æ of staff serves as their provider of ‚Äúwalking around money‚Äù.",t3_d6xoro,some interesting food for thought a mostly a lurker on the aita board i can defiantly see op s point\though i do wonder if part of the point of the sub is have a look at the detail and encourage people to think what might be social assholery should be taken with grain of salt or encourage reader to consider differently and thus have that be in mind the next time such a like event occurs for instance this example used by the op they ll think you re an asshole if you don t go out for drink with your co worker once in a while something like that seems entirely dependent on the micro social culture engendered by the place in question\in the 4 almost 5 year i have been at my job no one ha ever mentioned or pursued anything like the staff getting together for drink or anything even remotely semi social outside of work and if anything if someone were to come in and begin doing so in a more than passive suggestion i dare say the feeling amongst the regular staff would be the inverse\the micro climate here is filled with mostly post retiree who used to work in education in some way shape or form\the last thing they would be enthusiastic to pursue is a semi casual social obligation to satisfy workplace nicety i am sure 3 or 4 them would be of the mind that one of the pro of being retired is no longer have to do such thing in order to play office politics or not be that guy especially from a job that for ¬æ of staff serf a their provider of walking around money

I mean there was a post a couple of weeks ago where the OP had not allowed his friend to come under his umbrella (context: he told them to buy their own and that he wouldn't share, but when it was heavily raining, he stated in the post that he continued to not allow them under the umbrella, purely out of principle). For some reason, a lot of comments (I won't say majority or minority) were saying that OP wasn't an asshole because of the idea that people like that will never change. One comment stated along the lines of, ""It would set a precedent that his friends would easily be able to take advantage of him whenever they wanted."", even though it seemed like this was a one-time incident. The idea that people legitimately might think that a one-time incident will undoubtedly lead to a downspiral in the relationship is one of the most absurd ways of thinking (extreme thinking).

Despite that, it's still honestly great to hear different takes on a situation/scenario, but it's jarring to see people massively downvote comments that have their own opinion and support when they might have a fair point. HOWEVER, I will say that some comments really do deserve the massive downvotes if they: A) Have no support for their rating (e.g. just giving a rating with no reason), or B) Go on a tangent or rant that really has nothing to do with the situation (e.g. Post is of a female dealing with a situation, and a commenter instead steers their opinion towards being misogynistic).

People come here to be judged *by their peers.* Anyone posting questions to this sub already has some respect for the views of the sub, and possibly the site as a whole.

To use something that popped up on another site, someone was venting that it's a waste of time to say good morning at work. It interrupts his work, acknowledging that it's morning is pointless, and we're not here to socialise.

He's sort of, mildly, right. What was explained to him was people aren't acknowledging it's morning; they're acknowledging they wish a colleague well. Humans are social creatures; it's a morning ritual that takes 1 second to reaffirm you've got the back of the people you spend 8 hours a day with. So even if you struggle with this concept, it's worth indulging in, because a more harmonious and collaborative office is worth your 1 second greeting in the morning.

I feel like if that question was asked here, a lot of responses would be ""NTA, you don't have to talk to anyone if you don't want to. Focusing on your work and sorting your stuff is valid. They can get with the program."" 

Sometimes you can be right, but it's better to be kind. If someone took the above advice to heart, the likely outcome is they get labeled the office asshole.

1140,1140,f0xaex4,t3_d6xoro,"Partly stealing a post I made elsewhere:

AITA is a karma sink if you drop below the comment fold. Once you're below, generally you only get downvoted, and you get downvoted *hard* if you're below the fold *and* went against the consensus.

On the plus side the mods don't like the downvoting either, they're just not sure what to do about it.

Another interesting thing is that early in a thread's lifetime you'll see a mix of opinions. Over time, the opinions with a minority judgment are downvoted out of visibility (and sometimes into oblivion). After enough time has passed, it looks like there is unanimous praise or condemnation of the OP.

Reddit has a simplistic voting system that tends to function poorly here. Because every top-level post has a judgment on it, it attracts attention from people who will reflexively downvote any judgment that differs from their own, *regardless* of content. Once hidden, it tends to stay down.

To show that I'm not *completely* talking out of my ass here, here's an example:

https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d4x0zs/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_26f_that_i_55m_will/f0hq29m/?context=3

The parent post here was sitting at -20 when I posted a reply essentially saying: ""I disagree, but this post should not have been downvoted"". After I posted, drawing attention to it, it gradually got built back up to around 146.

What do you think happens to people who take the time to write a good reply and get downvoted to oblivion, who *don't* have a stranger browse at low scores and gamble karma on pointing it out? Do you think they will stick around? What sort of people remain?

You know, I can sort of agree with your point about groupthink, but I'd be careful about it going the other way. It seems to me that people are coerced to come to the same opinions IRL, and I think people are free to say how they genuinely feel online.

There's a sort of freedom to be authentic that cyberspace allows, and I don't want to dismantle that. There's more groupthink in real life than online.

Which is why we see these entirely clueless people that come to shocking realizations only when they stop to think critically for a moment.

Technically that's true. But it's your sister. She's upset. Clearly you have some good relationship with her, to let her watch your kid. Maybe giving her a little money, or doing something nice isn't ""required"", but it should be done because you care about her. 

People need to realize that sometimes in life, we have to put up with  peccadilloes, especially from those we care about. No one is perfect.

This is literally every subreddit in the history of Reddit. 

Hell, it expands far beyond just Reddit. All internet communities experience this. The most vocal people in a community are usually the ones that are the most toxic. They spend all day every day drowning out all dissenting opinions until the dissenters simply get sick and leave, because they have better things to do.

According to reddit, not going to church once and be supportive to your gf is totally acceptable behavior, but the second someone doesn‚Äôt want to go to a pride event they are instantly the asshole.

I don‚Äôt have a problem with lgbtq+ people or religious people. But in either situation both couples took the wrong decision. Instead of working it out and trying to find a middle ground, they went to one extreme. 

If someone doesn‚Äôt want to go to a certain event that‚Äôs fine, if it‚Äôs your girlfriend that you really love then you‚Äôre going to do it at least once even if you don‚Äôt like it.

Maybe, just maybe, sometimes time people in the real world have different opinions from you and your friends.  
  
For example, while I agree with you about some of the examples you gave, like taking the last cookie or (attitude dependent) giving up your seat to the elderly, 
I disagree about going out for drinks with your coworkers once in awhile and driving 10 minutes out of your way to pick up a coworker whose car is in the shop for a week.  
Why? Because the first two are typical human social expectations of all demographics except assholes, the last two are not.  
Going out for drinks *at all* is not something everyone does, and hanging out off the clock with all of your coworkers is also not something everyone does, there are many demographics who don't find such things enjoyable and have no interest in doing them and so most people don't find those unwilling to participate to be assholes, just people who don't like those activities.  
As to driving the coworker to work, while most people would help out a friend being a coworker doesn't automatically make them friends and that sort of thing (going to someone else's home  and letting them into your vehicle with you) is not something you are required to do for just anybody. Simply working with someone doesn't make them your buddy and it's not anyone else's responsibility to make sure they have a way to work, it's theirs, which is why it is not being an asshole to decline.  
I have coworkers that have become friends over the years that I'd go far out of my way to help, and there's others that I work with every day that I barely know and would only trust on a limited basis and still others that I do know and wouldn't trust with even knowing that I lived 10 minutes away from them, let alone pick them up and take them home every day for a week.

The way reddit functions actively works against finding the nuance and compromise that are necessary to judge complex social situations, instead validating the most extreme positions and hot takes. 

It's easy to forget, but you're only ever seeing a small sliver of the total amount of comments on any given subject and the ones getting pushed to the top are the self-righteous of all stripes supporting each other, simplifying situations into black and white teams and trying to make their views seem more accepted than they truly are. You're not seeing 'normal' people comment, but the extremists out to convert others to their way of thinking. People who you normally wouldn't give the time of day, but who through manipulating the way the voting system rewards small, coordinated movements, make it appear as if they're worth taking seriously. 

That's something important to be aware of, because while you might notice when people you disagree with radicalise, know that the same is being done to you. There's many of these groups for whom AITA isn't a place to give advice but a place to indoctrinate people, made all the easier by having visible enemies in every thread to rail against. People only call it out when they disagree enough with it to see it as an opinion of a 'team' they don't want to be on and will agree with most popular opposite opinion to compensate.

""Doesn't align with the rest of the world""

Don't recall any polling or census questions. Kindly point to even the most miniscule of facts to back that up.


Your epic whining tantrum actually undermines your entire complaint. Your values clearly are NOT the majority. You're pissy because Reddit won't think they way you have decreed correct.

We get enough butthurt complaining from the mods, if you don't like the way AITA thinks you could always start your own sub. I doubt anybody would use it because it's very clear that you're in no way aligned with an overwhelmingly large majority.


 It's just an asshole move to complain this sub doesn't represent the ""world"" because very few people agree or vote as you would have them. You make no sense. Very few people agree with you but you're the one who represents the values of the majority? Really?

If you think your farts smell of roses and lavender, ok. When the rest of the room is gagging and asking where the rotten egg smell is originating don't pretend the crowd of people dry heaving have it all wrong.

It's not AITA, it's you. Opinions are not a value system by the way and it's beyond absurd that you're looking to make some sort of values statement using this sub. It's truly rediculous to me that you'd complain that people's solicited opinions are the problem. It's the whole damn point.

One of if not the foundational value of western civilization, and it's an inconvenience. People on the internet way too often jump in to defend unvirtuous, unethical, or even degenerate behaviour. Why? I am not too sure, but I'm guessing it's partially because it's more convenient. People are biased in favour of an OP who presents their story in a certain way, people want to defend bad behaviour that they know they themselves would prefer exhibiting in such a situation even if their conscience knows better. 

Ah there is another thing, just actually listening to your conscience and letting it tell you what is and is not acceptable, it works 99% of the time, and everybody short of psychopaths have it there always, they just ignore it when convenient to their own detriment.

And it's definitely possible that in a lot of these situations the real truth is something like that there's a long history of someone's brother bringing his kids to family events and expecting the women to keep an eye on them while he's slugging Millers and watching football, and this last minute babysitting because he has an emergency is the last straw. 

So overall I agree with you and I think you make a really good point. Different groups face different levels of expectation of ""go along to get along"".

It's more complicated than that. Sure, **some** people around here are like that, but often they hate the fact that servers have to rely on tips. We're not going to solve that by not tipping when appropriate, obviously. Whoever goes from ""servers should be paid living wages; making that the customer's responsibility is stupid"" to ""don't tip anyone ever"" is TA. At the same time, when a server is rude or incompetent, you'll see ""fuck them, they deserve it,"" and I can see why. Rewarding incompetence or rudeness goes against people's principles, and I can't completely disagree with that.

>This sub hates infidelity. If you ever suggest ""might have had a hall pass; the relationship may have been broken; consider what you can't see,"" you will be downvoted.

I mean ... does anyone not? If a relationship is broken, leaving that relationship is the best option (often complicated by circumstances, sure, but nobody's saying it's an easy way out; it's the right way out). Non-monogamy between consenting parties is another story entirely, but if you're entering a monogamous relationship and you end up not being monogamous, you're TA.

Is it understandable people don't find the right way to break up? Sure.  
Do people make mistakes? Yep. Does that make them TA indefinitely and irrevocably? No.  
But it does make them TA temporarily, in that specific instance. Nobody's saying there aren't extenuating circumstances. I'm not saying it's unforgivable. But it **is** asshole behaviour, and that's what the sub is about.

>There's very little engagement with posts that people disagree with - they just downvote, instead of replying.

This is where I agree - but that's a Reddit-wide thing, and a real-life thing. Polite (or, hell, impolite) discussion between disagreeing parties is, for some reason, not something that's happening a lot. It should be. You won't always be able to convince the person you're having a discussion with, but some degree of learning will occur if both parties are actually interested. Sometimes, dissenting opinions can strengthen your own beliefs because you suddenly realise what part of the other side's argument you disagree with the most.

1948,1948,f0w86s2,t1_f0w71bu,"I mean, speaking just for myself, a lot of times I find myself torn between wanting to at least articulate the opposite point of view and put it out there versus feeling like I don't have the energy to be nuanced and reasonable on the internet and then deal with 20 people calling me a sexist jackass.

Like, I agree. I don't care about karma in a larger sense. But it can be frustrating and demoralizing to have people downvoting your opinions into the core of the earth and giving the people insulting you +100 for saying things that feel objectively ridiculous. It just feels pointless and like you're not getting through to anyone anyways no matter how much you try to explain and have a good discussion.

I remember a post from a while ago about a girl who wanted to wear heels to prom even though she was taller than her boyfriend, but he was insecure about his height and asked her not to wear them. I said something like NAH/mild YTA, because people can't help their insecurities, and it isn't reasonable to expect him to just get over this overnight. It's unfortunate that he feels that way and in a perfect world he wouldn't, but it would be hard to be the only guy in the prom photos who was being dwarfed by his girlfriend. Society constantly tells guys that height is incredibly important, and in high school it's hard to not be insecure about being short. In the scheme of things, I think it would be a little inconsiderate of you to prioritize wearing your first choice shoes over making a small concession to help your insecure boyfriend have a fun night.

I got so crazy massively down voted for that. I got all kinds of abuse for that. And so I pretty quickly gave up responding, because people were just being really nasty, talking anecdotally about how their boyfriend is short and secure so everyone should be able to do it, and generally not addressing what I actually said. So I stopped responding pretty quickly, even though I stand by my opinion and I think it was reasonable. Not the only or obvious answer, but certainly reasonable.",t3_d6xoro,i mean speaking just for myself a lot of time i find myself torn between wanting to at least articulate the opposite point of view and put it out there versus feeling like i don t have the energy to be nuanced and reasonable on the internet and then deal with 20 people calling me a sexist jackass\like i agree\i don t care about karma in a larger sense\but it can be frustrating and demoralizing to have people downvoting your opinion into the core of the earth and giving the people insulting you 100 for saying thing that feel objectively ridiculous\it just feel pointless and like you re not getting through to anyone anyways no matter how much you try to explain and have a good discussion\i remember a post from a while ago about a girl who wanted to wear heel to prom even though she wa taller than her boyfriend but he wa insecure about his height and asked her not to wear them\i said something like nah mild yta because people can t help their insecurity and it isn t reasonable to expect him to just get over this overnight\it s unfortunate that he feel that way and in a perfect world he wouldn t but it would be hard to be the only guy in the prom photo who wa being dwarfed by his girlfriend\society constantly tell guy that height is incredibly important and in high school it s hard to not be insecure about being short\in the scheme of thing i think it would be a little inconsiderate of you to prioritize wearing your first choice shoe over making a small concession to help your insecure boyfriend have a fun night\i got so crazy massively down voted for that\i got all kind of abuse for that\and so i pretty quickly gave up responding because people were just being really nasty talking anecdotally about how their boyfriend is short and secure so everyone should be able to do it and generally not addressing what i actually said\so i stopped responding pretty quickly even though i stand by my opinion and i think it wa reasonable\not the only or obvious answer but certainly reasonable

By contrast, being an asshole simply means that your actions do not align with the societal standards of decency or acceptable behavior under the circumstances 

So with that being said, it makes no sense to say that someone is justified in doing something (i.e. their actions are socially acceptable/reasonable) while maintaining that they are assholes for doing it (i.e. their actions are not socially acceptable/reasonable).

Sure, it's your apartment so you can technically wear your underwear when your roommate has guests over. And sure, it's your body so you can technically post risqu√© pictures of yourself on Instagram for your thirsty followers even if your boyfriend isn't comfortable with it. And sure, you can sleep with your brother's wife's sister at your brother's wedding when he asked you not to. But these things don't mean that the people involved have to just deal with it and that your relationships with them won't be affected.

>No reason not to demonize the right wing, considering they are literal human garbage.

Sorry, but I disagree. I know a number of people who consider themselves conservative, and a lot of them are truly compassionate people that I consider to be extremely misguided and out of touch with how the political system takes advantage of their supposed ""shared values"" to get them to elect politicians that perpetuate really harmful policies.

Obviously that's not all of them. Some of them are really just selfish and garbage people. And in that sub I agree that there is very often a really large amount that I would consider to be toxic to the point of being almost unreachable. 

But in general, I don't think just writing people off is a good idea. I don't think most people, conservative or liberal, see themselves as bad people. I think a really good example is the abortion debate. In my real life, I know a lot of people that are single issue voters on that issue. Not because they ""want to control women's bodies"", but because they genuinely believe that abortion is killing a child.

Now, I can't argue with them about that premise. I recognize that's sort of beyond the scope of what I can hope to convince people of. But I have had success and managed to change the minds of several people I know by helping them realize that even though planned parenthood does perform abortions, the other services they offer actually prevent an overwhelming number of unplanned pregnancies. Therefore, to reduce overall abortion numbers, it makes sense to support planned parenthood.

Obviously, it's a drop in the political bucket, but I've personally managed to sway the perspective of several people in my life with that argument. And it would never have been possible if I just assumed the least generous possible interpretation of their reasons for being anti-abortion and refusing to engage them.

People are conflating so many things with being an asshole: Being technically wrong, being morally wrong, being selfish, being overly individualistic. None of these things make you an asshole, being an asshole is just being *mean*. And sometimes you gotta be mean, and sometimes you don't.  

If people keep asking you to go out of your way for them and it starts to become an expectation, at some point you need to be an asshole and say no.  

If someone is doing something technically correct and within their rights that is causing undue harm to another person, you'd be a HERO if you chose to step up and be the asshole.

It depends on what we consider to be an ""asshole"". The way I see it, you don't have to do anything that isn't your responsability. I feel like if the person helped, they were a nice person. If they didn't, they weren't. But they weren't the asshole either.

Basically, doing nothing is not the same as doing something negative. I think that's where I draw the line.

Back in the day, Reddit did actually show the approximate number of upvotes **and** downvotes on every comment. It made things really interesting, since you could have a total score of +1, but also have a hundred downvotes canceling a hundred upvotes. I was so disappointed when they changed that system.  

Nowadays, you can only see if your comment is ""controversial"" (with the little red dagger symbol next to it), meaning you've received a decent number of up- and downvotes... but even then, I think you have to opt in via the settings.

2725,2725,f0wv00p,t1_f0wqlek,"I don‚Äôt think an hour is enough. Not nearly enough. I think it should stay in contest until judgment is rendered honestly. 

Only a certain subset read new under-hour posts, including many who, instead of posting how they really feel are creating a post that they think will be voted to the top comment to get another point. They decide this by perusing what the comments are already saying and not thinking through the whole situation very well oftentimes. This creates on popular new threads an echo chamber of people trying to quickly create the best top-vote worthy comment on flimsy reasoning. That creates a glut of one-sided shallow opinions. And not only that,  it once people take a stand on a judgment and post it, even if based on shallow reasoning, they tend to stick to their judgment later on and fight for why it‚Äôs correct, despite new reasonings and aspects and stuff brought up by others. 

Most people read the popular posts, where contest mode has ended for awhile. I have seen SO many threads where the initial (and top voted) comments are all one-sides, then later people who have nothing to lose because they know they‚Äôre too late to be top comment start pouring out the complexities of the situation and often the tide of opinion turns to a more complex (and in my opinion correct) opinion.... but it‚Äôs still drowned out by all the earlier shallow opinions and all the upvotes for them. I‚Äôve seen it over and over and over again. I could name so many but one is the dad who didnt teach his older son who didn‚Äôt live with him his secret special skill, but taught his younger twins who did live with him and helped them start a very lucrative business. The older son wasn‚Äôt happy and all the initial responses and all the most upvoted comments said he wasn‚Äôt an asshole, that his older son was, and that he didn‚Äôt owe his older son anything so screw him. Later comments started pointing out the complexities of the situation and the things the father did that weren‚Äôt so great and once people started considering those things most agreed (judging by upvotes/downvotes later on) but it was too late. And I could name dozens of other thread examples like this. 

I‚Äôm not saying contest mode going longer is going to solve all this, but it‚Äôs one thing that would help. Honestly I‚Äôm just ranting in general.

For example, if a coworker played a childish prank on you (e.g. putting hot sauce in your coffee), and you decided to take revenge with another prank (e.g. feeding him oreos filled with toothpaste), you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who would consider you an asshole. Immature, maybe, but not an asshole, because you were *justified.*

2890,2890,f0xs1pc,t1_f0wweqy,">  One person I saw said if you put spicy stuff in your food you had better be prepared to eat it in front of the judge. With nothing to back him up but reddit itself.

I think because this actually *did* happen, kind've. I'll look for the citation, but I remember reading the story about a man whose lunch was stolen and the thief reported the guy for having food that was insanely spicy, likely as a booby trap. The thing is, the guy actually ate crazy spicy food regularly. He showed his lunch to the manager (*not judge*) and ate it without issue, so the matter was dropped.

But I think the point is that if you were accused of using ghost peppers as a booby trap, you'd better be able to actually eat ghost peppers and show that they are a normal part of your diet.

As for why someone would admit it? People are fucking nuts, man. There are people who call the cops because someone stole their illegal drugs! And Managers may not give a shit about food thieves, but will get pissed if someone puts laxatives in food and creates a potential criminal case at the company. 

Also, while you're totally right that a lot of stuff on LA is bullshit (the only real advice people should ever get there are Government agencies they can contact, ""people often threaten to sue but rarely do, get a lawyer if you actually do receive a summons"", and ""this sounds like an actual problem. Don't talk to anyone about this, especially law enforcement/other party and their lawyers and get an actual attorney""), much of the advice is for best practices. 

Will you be charged and convicted for booby trapping your food? Probably not. But you don't need to go to trial to fuck up your life, and it's a dumb fucking way to get back at a food thief. Ultimately, the true message of that advice is that the person is not as clever as they think they are, and that when people think they found a way to beat the system because ""how can they prove I don't eat ghost peppers stuffed with laxatives"", they're generally wrong.",t3_d6xoro,one person i saw said if you put spicy stuff in your food you had better be prepared to eat it in front of the judge\with nothing to back him up but reddit itself\i think because this actually did happen kind ve\i ll look for the citation but i remember reading the story about a man whose lunch wa stolen and the thief reported the guy for having food that wa insanely spicy likely a a booby trap\the thing is the guy actually ate crazy spicy food regularly\he showed his lunch to the manager not judge and ate it without issue so the matter wa dropped\but i think the point is that if you were accused of using ghost pepper a a booby trap you d better be able to actually eat ghost pepper and show that they are a normal part of your diet\a for why someone would admit it\people are fucking nut man\there are people who call the cop because someone stole their illegal drug\and manager may not give a shit about food thief but will get pissed if someone put laxative in food and creates a potential criminal case at the company\also while you re totally right that a lot of stuff on la is bullshit the only real advice people should ever get there are government agency they can contact people often threaten to sue but rarely do get a lawyer if you actually do receive a summons and this sound like an actual problem\don t talk to anyone about this especially law enforcement other party and their lawyer and get an actual attorney much of the advice is for best practice\will you be charged and convicted for booby trapping your food\probably not\but you don t need to go to trial to fuck up your life and it s a dumb fucking way to get back at a food thief\ultimately the true message of that advice is that the person is not a clever a they think they are and that when people think they found a way to beat the system because how can they prove i don t eat ghost pepper stuffed with laxative they re generally wrong

Even if you *were* allergic to hot sauce, if your coworker didn't know that and clearly wasn't trying to assassinate you, such a retaliation would be unreasonable. Both parties would be considered assholes -- your coworker, because he's trying to start shit for (seemingly) no reason, and you, for escalating the conflict beyond what could be considered a reasonable response.

It sometimes happens when someone keeps trespassing on property or stealing  property. Owner gets mad and sets a boobytrap to harm the intruder the next time it happens. Owner goes to jail. Doesn't matter that it's his property. Doesn't matter that the person was trespassing. The owner acted with intent to injure someone and that's a crime. Same principle applies to boobytrapping food.

3161,3161,f0xami3,t1_f0x8vqb,"Well I‚Äôm with you on your opinion. Still, I think there‚Äôs no way you can please everyone and the vocal minority shouldn‚Äôt get the cookies just because they‚Äôre loud. You shouldn‚Äôt get death threats that‚Äôs just wrong, but the way I feel is, next time there‚Äôs a vote the longer contest modes should be offered sand if one wins it wins, and if not okay too. 

I‚Äôm almost wondering if this might also need a rethink in verdict time too. I see a contest mode that lasts until the verdict is in as the best option for these problems, so to offset those who hate the 18 hour contest mode the verdicts could just happen sooner. Like 6, 9, or 12 hour verdicts accompanied with contest mode until verdict, then afterwards sorted by best/top but verdict already rendered. This lets varied opinions have more visibility and a, in my opinion, fairer verdict, while also then letting people get into longer discussions based on high voted comments (it seems popular posts get to the front page after six hours or so maybe and then stay for 18 hours to over a day). 

And I was there way back when for the great verdict time debate. In fact, I‚Äôm not positive but I may have been the first one to suggest 18 hours! Someone else or others may already have. But I definitely remember seeing 12 and 24 as debated options and suggesting 18 as an alternative when I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone mention it, which that post got a lot of upvotes and well here we are, heh. 

So it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt like 18 hour verdicts. But times change and the reason for the longer verdict was to give more time for a verdict to possibly change upon further discussion. The sub has grown so much since then though and the top comment hardly ever (maybe never) changes after a few, at the most say 6-9, hours anymore (and I‚Äôd say the large majority of the time doesn‚Äôt change after the first two or three hours once the top post is set). Back then they did. Now there are just too many eyeballs viewing and voting for whatever the top comments already are as the post gets popular and reaches the front page. Then it‚Äôs too late for any change. 

So personally I think it‚Äôd benefit the sub on its current state to shorten verdict time now to 6-12 hours, set contest mode until the verdict is in, and then after that the threads are just regular discussion threads like any other sub.",t3_d6xoro,well i m with you on your opinion\still i think there s no way you can please everyone and the vocal minority shouldn t get the cooky just because they re loud\you shouldn t get death threat that s just wrong but the way i feel is next time there s a vote the longer contest mode should be offered sand if one win it win and if not okay too\i m almost wondering if this might also need a rethink in verdict time too\i see a contest mode that last until the verdict is in a the best option for these problem so to offset those who hate the 18 hour contest mode the verdict could just happen sooner\like 6 9 or 12 hour verdict accompanied with contest mode until verdict then afterwards sorted by best top but verdict already rendered\this let varied opinion have more visibility and a in my opinion fairer verdict while also then letting people get into longer discussion based on high voted comment it seems popular post get to the front page after six hour or so maybe and then stay for 18 hour to over a day\and i wa there way back when for the great verdict time debate\in fact i m not positive but i may have been the first one to suggest 18 hour\someone else or others may already have\but i definitely remember seeing 12 and 24 a debated option and suggesting 18 a an alternative when i hadn t seen anyone mention it which that post got a lot of upvotes and well here we are heh\so it s not like i don t like 18 hour verdict\but time change and the reason for the longer verdict wa to give more time for a verdict to possibly change upon further discussion\the sub ha grown so much since then though and the top comment hardly ever maybe never change after a few at the most say 6 9 hour anymore and i d say the large majority of the time doesn t change after the first two or three hour once the top post is set\back then they did\now there are just too many eyeball viewing and voting for whatever the top comment already are a the post get popular and reach the front page\then it s too late for any change\so personally i think it d benefit the sub on it current state to shorten verdict time now to 6 12 hour set contest mode until the verdict is in and then after that the thread are just regular discussion thread like any other sub

He's tried to talk to her about this issue and she claims she isn't that bad 

When asked to look at timestamps on those calls she gets defensive and won't because they are proof OP is right. 

Even after multiple conversations about it it still happens. 

He finally had enough and went to a more extreme option to drive home how fed up he is with this. 

Plus he didn't remove the Bluetooth so she couldn't have conversations. He removed the stereo faceplate so she couldn't mute it on him.
