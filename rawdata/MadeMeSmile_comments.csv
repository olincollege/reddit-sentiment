He made sure to tell me beforehand and I told him if he needed any help I would be there, my sales be damned. I had a grandfather with Alzheimer’s. I would sit with her while he went to get water since it was so hot. She’d repeatedly ask where he was and I would repeat that he went to get water etc. Other vendors commented on my patience.  I told them it isn’t hard. She isn’t annoying. She literally can’t remember she already asked. It was super hot that weekend so I would buy them those orange pushpops and we would eat together. She was so happy and so excited. He thanked us at the end of the event. Sadly the next year I learned he had passed away but his son had taken over and was with his mom. We didn’t get the chance to talk and I didn’t want to stress her out by asking if she remembered us. It takes nothing to be kind.",t3_ho4otc

6,fxfwhzg,t3_ho4otc,"When i was in cosmetology school, q woman came in for just a smille manicure. I got her ticket and shortly after I started, she was crying. I stopped for a moment and asked her if she was okay, she said this was the first time she's gotten a manicure in 8 months and the first since her daughter passed from cancer. She talked about her daughter, her love for animals, her favorite colors, and how they would have a spa day every month until she got sick. After I was done and walked her back to the front, she bought a few things from me and then asked if she could hug me. I let her and she just held me and squeezed for a few minutes and then thanked me. 

One of my teachers seen and asked if i knew her, I told her no, and explained what happened, she also hughed me and told me that I probably made her so happy. She came back in a week later and gave me a $10 tip from the week before and a sunflower from her daughters funeral because I mentioned how I love sunflowers and that was also her daughters favorite. 

This profession can suck, but it can be very rewarding. Ive had a few stories similar but this one really stuck with me and 2 years later, I still think about her from time to time.",t3_ho4otc

9,fxfzavx,t3_ho4otc,"Am a hairdresser. One of my seasoned co-workers told me a story when I was first starting out about how when she was still kinda new, she had a normal day of clients, had a new lady come in for the first time to get her hair cut and styled. 
She said the appointment was real normal, just basic questions about herself and casual nice small talk and getting to know each other. The lady left and didn’t book another appointment. 
She got an email about a week later from the lady telling my co-worker that she probably didn’t realize the impact that she had on people and how just being nice could change everything. The woman had come to get her hair done because she was going to kill herself that night and didn’t want her family to have to worry about getting her made up for a funeral. 
She felt entirely different after that appointment and made sure to tell my coworker that she was the reason she decided not to go through with killing herself that night.

By the end of the week, and after a lot of effort on both our parts, he had got the hang of it and was zooming around. A month later my boss gets an email from the family explaining that they always thought it was impossible he would ever be able to ski, as he could barely stand on skis on previous trips.

My mom passed away last year.  Her sister, her best friends and myself spend much time with her in her final days, but my mom had a whole list of people she wanted to say goodbye to. She wrote them all a personal, hand-written letter. One of the letters was for her hairdresser, whom she had become good friends with in the 10+ years she was her customer.

I’ve been there working at a grocery store and one guy came in twice a week for over a year for just mini watermelons (silly I know) and I always picked them for him. I’d even cut them in half to make sure they were good since he wanted them year round.

Suddenly I didn’t see him for two months until one evening right before closing he showed up, cracked a quick joke and told me something that made me cry in the back room and I still do when I think about it to this day.

His wife had been battling stage 4 breast cancer for almost two years and said she enjoyed every watermelon he ever brought home and it was one of the few things she was actually able to eat.

187,fxfxzno,t3_ho4otc,"I have experience with people with dementia.  If I can make one recommendation to their family members and friends it would be this: **you** calling attention to what **they** don't recall creates more stress than anything.

You have to treat someone with dementia almost like an imaginative child.  Whatever journey their brain takes them on, **join them.** Don't try to force them to remember things they don't remember in that moment - you're not doing it to improve their memory (it doesn't work like that), you're doing it to find some semblance of the person you remember.  And when you do that, you point out to them that their memories are wrong or not theirs, and they get frustrated and angry.

Join them on their journey and you'll actually find it's a beautiful thing.  Because while they are certainly losing their memory, you'll find their sense of humor and personality to be very similar.  So as they start talking about weird shit, if you join them on that, you'll still have the ""same person"" to keep you company, and they'll be much more themselves with less anger, less outbursts, and less frustration.",t3_ho4otc

When I was in college I volunteered with a group at the local university that paired students with a person that had been diagnosed with dementia. Over the next year, we met up once a week and went a museum. One of my favorite things to do was to bring him by this sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that he just adored. He always told me that he liked it because he had experienced it with his wife many years ago. This story changed every single time he told it but did it matter? HELL NO 

The joy he felt being in the present moment and having this “memory” brought him so much happiness I would have heard that story 50 more times and it still wouldn’t have mattered. The reality is that with this disease, the happy times are rare. It is incredibly hard on the person and the caretaker so any time there is something that brings joy into their world. It is just... the best. 

Furthermore, for me now that I am in medical school, I would recommend to anyone that is interested in this field to work with the elderly. Working with this man taught me more about life, its hardships, our identity, love, and pain than any class or shadowing experience I ever had and he never even really knew my name. It truly changed my life and kudos to the OP for being patient and understanding with someone who lives in a world of confusion. We need more people like you in this world.",t3_ho4otc

My favorite story of hers is that a customer came in with hair grown past her hips, she had tears in her eyes tellling my mom that she fell asleep with gum and it got stuck in her hair creating a massive rats nest. She had been to multiple hair shops asking for help and they all said the best they could do was cut damn near all of it off, but she was very attached to her hair and didn't want to do that. My mom sat with her for hours carefully combing her hair until she could get the gum dislodged. For the time and money that took, my mom really didn't have to do that for her.

He didn't want to buy anything but he just told me that he had been diagnosed with cancer and they had stopped the treatment and he told me that he was gonna die very soon. I didn't really know how to react and I don't think he did either. He said that he had been alone for a long time and that he had cherished the moments when he was in our store and could talk to us. It was quite sureal that we as a retail store was such a big part of his life that he wanted to come in and say goodbye for a last time.

406,fxgay2r,t3_ho4otc,"I once got a letter like that. I was a resident on ER duty and a woman came in with a stroke. We were a rural hospital so I explained everything that was happening to her and her husband and quickly organized a transport to a stroke center. A few days later, she was sent back to wait in our hospital for her bed in rehab. 

About 18 months later, she came to my ward for a simple infection that needed i.v. Antibiotics. She talked a lot without really being able to form a complete sentence or make sense at all (Wernicke aphasia). This was all that seemed to have remained from her stroke but it was so bad, I could hardly understand her. I felt really bad for her, but she seemed very happy all the time. After two days, her husband caught me in the hallway and gave me a letter, thanking me profusely. In the letter, he had written how eternally thankful they were to me for helping in his wife's recovery. Specifically that I took the time to explain everything to them, eventhough it had to be a stressful moment for me. How she had re-learned to walk and even ride a bike. And how they are now able to go bird-watching together - something they didn't thing would be possible after the stroke. The letter included a blue feather from some rare bird they had seen. They said it was extremely rare to find a feather like that and they wanted me to have it. 

You Bett I still have this letter s d the feather. I reread it often when I struggled with my profession and it has been an eye-opener. I realized that even the smallest thing I do for people in acute crisis can have the most profound impact that goes way beyond the physical necessity. And that I always need to be aware of that and empathic to the crisis my patients are in.",t3_ho4otc

The Best hairdresser I ever had did my hair every time between the ages of 14 and 18. The last time was for my high school graduation. I wasn't opposed to having any colour or style of hair so I sort of just let her go crazy and experiment. I would literally give her free reign to do whatever she wanted and I loved it every fucking time (and she loved me for it).

She had black and white portrait tattoos on her biceps of Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash, short blonde hair (kind of pinup style) and I thought she was so fucking cool. And as an ugly duckling kind of awkward teenager with low self esteem, she made me feel so pretty and confident.

I wish I could find her again so badly but all I have is a first name and a description.

Marissa from Calgary, if you're reading this by some fucking miracle, please DM me! Or if you know her, please DM me. I would love for her to do my hair again even though it's been a decade since I saw her last. And in that decade, I've NEVER found someone anywhere near as great as she was.",t3_ho4otc

It is so rewarding to see the look on someone’s face after giving them a good haircut and knowing they feel like themselves again, and knowing I have the power to give someone that feeling is indescribable. Not only that but getting to know someone by doing their hair, being the person they feel like they can talk to, being there for them after they have children, when they get married, when they experience loss. Being the person that lifts them up by just doing what feels like a routine, simple thing, but knowing it’ll make a huge difference to them.

It made me so sad to see her in such a state so I bathed her and took her to her beauty shop Violet and Olga's place she was a regular but hadn't been back in ages. They were so happy to see her and they talked the whole time. She lit up like she lost 20 years and could see again.  she couldn't but she felt human and she loved her haircut which actually looked great.

One of his usual clients called for styling but it wasn’t her usual day or service but the cosmetologist didn’t think much of it at the time. During the service he said he felt an overwhelming sense of needing to be present in the moment and talk with the girl whose hair he was working on. They had a normal conversation and she went on her way. A few days later he received a letter that said something along the lines of “I came to you to do my hair and you didn’t know that I was having a hard time. The way you treated me like a human and paid attention to me really made my day. I was coming to get my hair done because I was going home to kill myself and wanted to look okay when they found me.

I don't think i did anything particularly special for hern and if she hadn't mentioned it I'd have had 0 idea that I'd meant anything to her.

But that letter really shaped how cognizant i was of the effect consistent, casual kindness can have on those we interact with throughout life, and have tried to default to kindness wherever possible. (Always a work in progress).

It also made me realize how special getting thanked is, and made me more likely to let peoplenknow when i was grateful.

I do still remember some people who come see me once a year on their anniversary vacation. They're an extremely awesome and wealthy older couple from New Zealand. My bar is in the US. We have 7 years of consecutive selfies together. I know all their kid's and grandkid's names. 

They told me last year that they won't be coming back this year... especially since the pandemic started. 

BUT they invited me to come stay in their guest house.

Once things settle down, I'm going to New Zealand to see them.

I see hundreds of people a day yet they're the only ones who feel like family... and we live on opposite sides of the world :)",t3_ho4otc
1091,fxhaulf,t1_fxg14ae,Omg that was so very kind of you to write! I'm currently going to be recertifying my old teletech cert that I never used to do that for now. I'm still a new cosmetologist and it's hard to support yourself in the beginning and with the current situation as well I just would rather come back to it when it was safer and I had a bit more of a safety net. With teletech I can pay my bills and i used to also work in the ER so I have a lot of EKG experience so it feels the best place but I have been considering. With an RN and cosmetology license there's a lot of neat fields I can go into. I really appreciate you taking time to write that out. I had a really awful time as a CNA and a lot of RNs who were really up about themselves and looked down on us aides. I'm glad you appreciate us bc that's means you're probably an amazing RN. All the RNs that were aides before were always the best and worked really hard. They care about their patients and didn't underestimate the physical and emotional job it is to be an aide so thank you for appreciating us! I hope you're staying safe and able to get some days off to rest and recoup. I know it's really hard right now and has to be exhausting. You're amazing thank you,t3_ho4otc

It makes my whole day to feel like I gave someone a boost. 

This week a lady cried in my chair because she had had an awful time in quarantine and was so happy to feel like herself again. I was honestly really afraid to come back to work and I still am afraid of getting sick, but it just felt so good to help someone who was also having a hard time. 

Especially when it’s someone who has really struggled with their identity or appearance or confidence; shy teenagers, or clients with conditions that effect their hair that make them self conscious, or people transitioning who are learning to be confident presenting themselves in a different way.
