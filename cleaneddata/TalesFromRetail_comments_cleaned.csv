There's a burger place in Copenhagen called Banana Joe's (little shop but very popular and juicy burgers) and inside there is the large, friendly owner who works there almost every day. I'm on my way to my friends so I order 3 Cheese&Bacons + fries to go. I wait 5 minutes or so and he hands me the bag and I ask him if it's ok that I pay by card (in Copenhagen a lot of stuff is done through cards/mobile pay) but he says I cannot and I offer to quickly pop to the ATM and withdraw money (not that far away). He stops me and says ""No no. I want you to enjoy these burgers fresh and warm, stop by tomorrow and pay."" 

So there I am somewhat starstruck with what he's saying and ask him if he's sure. He says yes and to enjoy my evening.

Like at the store I worked in, if you showed your membership card for the shopping center, you'd get a percentage off if your total was over a certain amount. We didn't have to physically collect anything or swipe anything, so it was totally untracked. On one occasion, a customer had a $110 purchase with a ton of little things, but she was a couple bucks short on cash. She apologized profusely and asked if I could put her purchase on hold so she could run out to her car and get some more cash, apologizing the whole time. I didn't feel like going through the effort it would take to hold this transaction and didn't want to make her run to the car, so I just entered the coupon and said ""ok you have enough cash now.""

438,438,d5oj57p,t1_d5o45an,"I think OP is saying that if G was short $0.36 and had to cancel the sale. The ice cream shop would have thrown away the dessert and put the money back on the gift card. They would be out whatever their cost for the ice cream and toppings was.


For example, kid has $5 gift certificate and orders a $5 banana split. The cost of product is $1.00, they sell it for $5.00, but with tax it comes to $5.36. They have already made the banana split with the toppings the kid wanted. If the sale is voided they give him back the $5 gift card and are stuck with food that cost the store $1 to make, that they now have to throw away.  Better to make $3.64 in profit than lose a buck. 

Hooking up a high school kid for 36 cents is worth it for the employee as well, because if that kid didn't know he should tip before, he does now and will return with friends and tip every time.

That's just it. The store would still make its full $4.64 profit because the store wouldn't be the one paying the difference, it's the cashier who took it out of their own tip money.
